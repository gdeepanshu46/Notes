# Indian Economy

------

## Introduction

- Economics is the study of production, distribution and consumption of goods and services in a society
- According to Adam Smith, father of economics, Economics is science of wealth
- Economics is social science and not science as it involves human behaviour 
- Economics is the optimal allocation of scarce resources to maximise human material wellbeing 
- had there been unlimited resources, Economics as a subject was not required then
- the core/central problem of any economy is resource allocation
- 2 branches of economics: Micro & Macro
- Microeconomics: it studies behaviour of individual economic units, ex - income of a person, output of a firm, price of product etc
- Macroeconomics: it studies an economic system as a whole, entire economy,
- it takes into account overall aggregates and averages of an economy, ex - (national income, GDP) are aggregates, (price level) is average etc
- Philosophy is the mother of all subjects
- Closed economy is one which does not have any economic relationship with the rest of the world	
- Economic/Productive activities in a specific region is known as the Economy of that region
- Around 21.9% ~ 22% people of India are under Poverty
- GDP, GNP & National Income are nearly same with minor differences
- GDP is Total Value of Goods & Services produced in India
- GNP is Total Value of Goods & Services produced by Indian either in India or Abroad

## Module 1 : Economic Growth & Development

### I - Basic Concepts

#### a. Economic Growth

- It refers to the process of increase in production of goods and services in an economy over a long period of time

- It refers to persistent increase in real GDP or real Per Capita Income (Real National Income divide by Population)

  ![image-20221127130106267](/Users/deepanshugupta/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20221127130106267.png)

#### b. Economic Development

- It refers to that process of economic growth which is accompanied by improvement in well being of people

- It refers to progressive changes in socio-economic structure of an economy

  | Economic Growth                | Economic Development                                     |
  | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Increase in Production         | Increase in Production + Social Welfare                  |
  | Unidimensional Concept         | Multidimensional Concept                                 |
  | Quantitative Concept           | Qualitative Concept                                      |
  | It is just a **means**         | It is an **objective** in itself                         |
  | It can be achived without ED   | It can sheldom be achieved without EG                    |
  | Indicators: Real GDP, Real PCI | Indicators: Human Development Index, Global Hunger Index |

#### c. Inclusive Growth

- According to UNDP, It is the process and the outcome where all groups of people have participated in the organisation of growth and have benefitted equitably from it

- According to OECD, IG is economic growth that is distributed fairly across society and creates opportunity for all

- OECD is Organisation for Economic Cooperation & Development, which is a group of Developed Countries like USA

  | Economic Development                                         | Inclusive Growth                                    |
  | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
  | It is an **outcome** only                                    | It is the **process** as well as the **outcome**    |
  | Objective is Social Welfare                                  | Objective is Participative Process & Social Welfare |
  | Redistributive Measures like Subsidies, Welfare Payments may lead to ED | RM may not lead to IG                               |

- Components of Inclusive Growth

  1. Employment Generation
  2. Increasing Employability by providing education, training, skill development, good health etc
  3. Reducing Poverty
  4. Equal opportunities for all
  5. Women Empowerment
  6. Good Governance
  7. Access to Basic Amenities for all

#### d. Human Development

- According to UNDP, It is the process of widening people's choices as well as raising the level of well-being achieved
- Diff btw HD & ED
  - HD is HD in general
  - ED is HD in an economy

#### e. Human Resource Development

- Also known as Human Capital Formation
- It refers to the process of enhancing productive potential of human beings by providing them education, training, skill development
- HD is a much wider concept while HRD is a narrower concept because HRD merely view human beings as productive resource while HD focuses on ehancing well-being of people

------

#### Standard of Living

- It refers to access to material things
- It is measured by Per Capita Income and is simply how much goods & sevices a person can buy
- Higher the income of a person, Higher is the standard of living
- Countries with higher average PCI have higher standar of living

#### Quality of Life

- Enhancing overall well-being of a person
- It is same as Human Development

------

#### Types of Capital

##### 1. Economic / Physical Capital

- It refers to stock of machinery, factory
- Capital is anything that enhance the productivity
- Better machinery, factory will enhance the productivity

##### 2. Human Capital

- Quantity and Quality of labour force
- Better quality of labour force enhances the productivity

##### 3. Social Capital

- Interpersonal Relations, cooperation and coordination among people, mutual trust etc	
- Ego clashes, distresses, struggles between management and workers in an org may hamper the productivity of that org
- Therefore it is important to have Social Capital to enhance the productivity

##### 4. Natural Capital

- It refers to natural factors which assist in production such as soil, natural resources etc 

------

#### f. Sustainable Development

- It refers to the process of development that can be sustained in future
- The Brandtland Commission defined it as - It is the development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the  ability of future generations to meet their own needs
- UN World Commission on Enviroment & Development was known as Brandt Land Commission
- Brandtland was the lady Prime Minister of Norway
- It calls for **Intergenerational** equity
- It is important to note that the degradation / depletion of environment can be done by us but at to a certain limit only in which the enviroment can replenish / rejuvenate itself
- The limit / capacity of environment to absorb adverse impacts of human activity is known as **Carrying Capacity**
- It is fine, to degrade enviroment within this capacity, but going beyond this capacity will have adverse effects
- Currently, we are degrading the enviroment beyond the Carrying Capacity and also reducing the Carrying Capacity by cutting down trees

##### Features of Sustainable Development

1. Real GDP should increase
2. Social Welfare should enhance
3. Conservation of Forest should be done

<u>Note</u> - Feature 1 is a feature of Economic Growth, Feature 1 & 2 of Economic Development, and Feature 1, 2 & 3 of SD

##### Dimensions of Sustainable Development

1. Economic Dimesion
2. Social Dimension
3. Environmental Dimension

<u>Note</u> - All 3 dimensions are interrelated

##### Indicators of Sustainable Development

1. Green GDP

   - It is the GDP adjusted for the cost of enviromental degradation
   - Few countries have their own conventions to measure the cost of money value of environmental degradation
   - In India, we are planning to introduce this concept but we don't have it right now
   - By and large, it is a theoretical concept

2. Genuine Savings

   - It is the Total Savings adjusted for Depreciation in man-made capital and Depreciation in natural capital

     Genuine Savings = Total Savings - Depreciation in man-made capital - Depreciation in natural capital

   - It is also a theoretical concept as measuring / estimating Depreciation in natural capital is a subject thing

##### Threats to Sustainable Development

1. Depletion of Resources - Renewable and Non-Renewable 
2. Degradation of Environment - Pollution, Soil Erosion, Deforestation etc
3. Loss of Biodiversity - Extinction of plants / animals

##### Measures to Sustainable Development

1. Govt. replacing Product Subsidies with Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)

   - Product Subsidies lead to decline in product prices leading to increase in consumption, thereafter overuse of resources and then further wastage of resources

   - Adopting DBT will not reduce the product price thereby making the consumer sensitive towards the purchase, then subsidies are credited to the beneficiaries post-purchase of the product

     ![image-20221128113006451](/Users/deepanshugupta/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20221128113006451.png)

2. Poverty Alleviation

   - It is often seen very poor people tend to pollute the enviroment more by Defecating in open, adopting methods of cultivation leading to environmental degradation
   - Reducing poverty can lead to Sustainable Development
   - It is not only important for Social Justice but for reducing environmental degradation too

3. Market Linked Approaches

   - Pollution tax should be levied from Firms causing pollution
   - Subsidies on environmental friendly tech should be given like Solar panels etc

4. Cautious use of Non-Renewable Resources like petrol, diesel, coal etc

5. Improvement of technology to reduce consumption of resources and to reduce pollution

6. Renewable Resources to be used within the limits within which these can be replenished by the environment, ex is Water

7. Mining to be replaced by Recycling as far as possible, Circular Economy approach should be adopted, 

   Production -> Consumption -> Recycling -> Production, leading to no waste

8. Environment Friendly Techniques like Organic / Natural Farming should be used

9. Creating Awareness and Participation of People

10. Increasing Participation of local bodies like Gobardhan scheme

11. International Cooperation

### II - Indicators of Economic Development / Inclusive Growth

#### 1. Net Economic Growth (NEW)

- Concept given by Paul Samuelson

  ![image-20221129111148985](/Users/deepanshugupta/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20221129111148985.png)

- It is a theoretical concept and not used practically as it is not possible to estimate factors like Value of Leisure etc

- The concept is discussed to answer the following question

- Is GNP / GDP a satisfactory indicator of Economic Development?

- Surely they are good indicators of Economic Growth but **NOT** of **ED**, as there are other factors that should be considered too

------

#### 2. Real Per Capita Income (PCI)

- It is a simple Average Income of a country
- It is regarded as an indicator of Standard of Living
- Increase in Real PCI reflects Economic Growth and not ED 
- It is not a satisfactory indicator of ED because 
   - It is based on National Income which itself is not a satisfactory indicator
   - It is based on value of NI but does not takes into account the composition of NI (what goods are produced)
   - Anything you produce, it increases the NI
   - It increases with increase in production of alcohol, tobacco, cigarettes, defence equipment etc
   - Increased production of these goods increases NI but does it increases Welfare? NO
   - That's why composition is also important, what kind of goods and services are produced in a country
   - It does not take into account Distribution of NI i.e. Inequalities
   - It is silent on the welfare dimension of ED namely Education, Health, Clean Env, Political Liberty, Socio Cultural factors, Psychological factors (Happiness) etc
- Still, Real PCI reflects the level of well being to a certain extent
- But NI / GDP / GNP does not reflect level of well being at all, they show the size of economy
- As India is 3rd largest Economy in terms of GDP, but not at all well off in terms of well being
- Size of Economy and Level of Development are 2 different things
- Size of Economy is reflected by Value of GDP and Level of Development is reflected by increase in GDP showing EG
- Size of Economy is not directly related with Level of Development
- SoE may be higher and LoD may be higher or lower
- SoE may be lower and LoD may be again higher or lower
- Countries like Singapore and Vatican City have smaller SoE but LoD is on higher side
- Whereas in countries like India SoE is on higher side still LoD is on lower side

------

#### 3. Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI)

- It was developed by M. D. Morris in 1979
- It has 3 components 
  1. Infant Mortality Rate
     - Child upto the age of 1 is known as Infant
     - It means the rate at which the infants are dying
     - If this rate is more, that means the conditions are bad in a country
     - Usually in backward / under-developed countries like in Africa, IMR is high due to lack of health facilities, nutrition etc
  2. Life Expectancy
     - It refers to the average life span of the people
     - If people are living longer life, it means living conditions are better in a country, people are getting basic amenities
  3. Adult Literacy
- All these dimensions were given value between 0 to 100, on the basis of the conditions in a country, individual values were given
- The average of all 3 values was known as the PQLI

------

#### 4. Human Development Index (HDI)

- It was developed by UNDP in 1990

- It was developed by a team of Economists of UNDP led by Professor Mehboob-Ul-Haq from Pakistan

- Prof A. K. Sen from India was also associated with this team

- Since 1990, it is being published in the Human Development Report of UNDP

- HDI is based on the following 3 dimensions : **Health**, **Knowledge** & **Standard of Living**<img src="/Users/deepanshugupta/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20221130092037354.png" style="width:800px" />

- **Mean Years of Schooling** - Average number of years of education received by people aged 25 years or more during their lifetime

- **Dimension Index** = (Actual Value - Min Value) / (Max Value - Min Value), as Actual Value can be as low as Min Value and as high as Max Value, so the DI can lie between [0, 1]

  <img src="/Users/deepanshugupta/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20221130105523669.png" style="height:600px" />

- Countries like Luxembourg have GI more than 1 lakh dollars, still the Max Value taken is 75000 dollars, this is because after a certain level, well being cannot be further improved with increase in GI

- For Ex - the well being of Ratan Tata would be same even if his wealth is increased by 20-30% further

- That's why countries with GI more than 75000 dollars is taken as 75000 dollars only

- Earlier HDI use to be the simple average of all the 3 indices, but it has changed now

- **HDI** is the **Geometric Mean** of the 3 Dimension Indices
  $$
  HDI = \sqrt[3]{LEI*EI*GI}
  $$

- The HDR 2010 made 4 important changes in the HDI

  1. AM changed to GM

  2. Adult Literacy changed to Mean Years of Schooling

  3. Children Enrolment Ratio changed to Expected Years of Schooling

  4. GDP Per Capita changed to GNI Per Capita

- The GM of the 3 Dimension indices of th HDI has made it sensitive to the inter dimensional inequlities

- As deficiency of 1 Dimension cannot be compensated by another Dimension, while AM use to do the other way round![image-20221201102401602](/Users/deepanshugupta/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20221201102401602.png)

- **Is HDI a perfect measure of Economic Development?**

  - No, because it is based on only 3 dimensions, although Economic Development is a multi-dimensional (Social, Cultural, Environmental, Hunger etc) concept 
  - The dimesions are qualitative in nature i.e. they cannot be measured with perfection. Education, health etc cannot be measured with perfection

- **What should be the approach to assess Economic Development if single index cannot capture all the dimensions?**

  - We should use different indices which measures different aspects of human well-being
  - for ex - Happiness Index will measure psychological well-being, Hunger Index measures the core amenity, the food 
  - So, we should supplement HDI with other indices which measures human well-being in other dimensions 

- Classification of countries according to UNDP![image-20221202165645673](/Users/deepanshugupta/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20221202165645673.png)

------

#### 5. Inequality-adjusted HDI

- It was introduced by UNDP in 2010, now in Human Development Report (HDR), both HDI and IHDI are published

- It accounts for inequalities in the 3 dimensions of HDI by discounting each dimension value according to its level of inequality

  ![image-20221203112659280](/Users/deepanshugupta/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20221203112659280.png)

- In the given example for countries India and ABC,

  - India has people with varied lifespan, thereby inequalities are there
  - In case of ABC, suppose every one lives for the same number of years, thus no inequalities are there, therefore,
  - more the variation or inequalities more the discounting is done, less the variation or inequalities less the discounting is done

- The discounting is made through the Atkinson Method

  ![image-20221203114310379](/Users/deepanshugupta/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20221203114310379.png)

- IHDI is always less than HDI because inequalities are bound to be there for every country

- Therefore, **IHDI is better than HDI**
