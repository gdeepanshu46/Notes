Union
-Parliament is the law making body of the Union
-it is bicameral, has two houses Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
-ideally, tenure of LS is 5 years, tenure of RS is infinite as it is a permanent body
-ideally, tenure of LS MPs is 5 years, tenure of RS MPs is 6 years
-in every 5 years, fresh elections are called to fill the LS
-in every 2 years, 1/3rd of the RS MPs retire, and new MPs are brought in
-at any point of time, atleast 2/3rd of the RS is always filled
-party that proves majority in LS forms the govt. their leader is made the P.M.
-the P.M. chosen has to be the member of the Parliament, if he is not so, he has to become a member within 6 months
-P.M. picks his council of ministers from LS/RS, collectively they are called Executives, or Govt. in layman's term
-Executives are those who implement laws made by the Legislative
-P.M. along with his council of ministers and a chain of officers (Bureaucracy) forms the Executives
-P.M. along with his council of minsiters are Political Executives, while chain of officers are Permanent Excecutives
-ministers chosen has to be a member of the Parliament, if not they have to be one withing next 6 months
-not every MP is a minister, but every minister is an MP
-P.M. can be from any of the house LS/RS, Manmohan Singh was from RS, Modi is from LK
-LK only containes elected members, RS has both elected, nominated members
-President nominates 12 members in the RS, who has exceptional knowledge in the field of Art/Literature/Science/Social Services
-Sachin Tendulkar, Mary Kom were exceptions that were nominated in RS from the field of Sports by the Supreme Court
-Constitutionally, Sports is not mentioned as the field to nominate someone
-The amendment act of 104 removed the 2 seats of Anglo-Indians that were nominated in the LS

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
State
-Similar to Parliament, we have State Legislative Assembly in the states
-6 states: UP, Bihar, Maharashtra, Karnataka, A.P., Telangana have 2 houses in the law making
-rest all states only have 1 house of law making
-the State Legislative Assembly and the State Legislative Council
-the members of the SLA are only elected just like LS, called MLA
-the members of the SLC are elected, nominated just like RS, called MLC
-Governor nominates some MLCs from the field of Art/Literature/Science/Social Science/Co-operative movements
-party that proves majority in the SLA forms the govt. 
-C.M. choses his council of minister in a similar way

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Constitution
-many countries have written constitution, while many have unwritten constitution
-India, Srilanka, U.S. have written one, while U.K. NZ, etc have unwritten one 
-this implies that countries like ours have laws written/codified in a book which we can call constitution
-while other countries doesn't have such a book
-they have various laws but not a single book called Constitution
-Written Constitution is one whose articles and provisions are written/codified into a single legal document/book
-in WC, distinct is made btw the provisions of Constitution and other laws
-in WC, it is the Constitution which is supreme and all other organs(Parliament, Executive, Judiciary) of the state are suppose to follow it
-in WC, Judiciary generally enjoys wider powers where it can declare an enactment/law of Parliament or action of Executive to be unconstitutional and thus nullified

-WC is an enacted Constitution i.e. it was made by a special body at a specific point of time
-WC may be rigid/flexible or a combination of both, in India, some parts can be changed easily, some with difficulty
-countris with WC may be federal/unitary
-Unwritten Constitution is one whose provisions are not codified/compiled into a single legal document/book
-in UC, each and every enactment of the Parliament becomes part of their Constitution
-i.e. there is no distinction btw Constitutional and other laws
-in UC, Parliament is supreme because every enactment/law of the Parliament becomes their Constitution
-in UC, Judiciary cannot declare an enactment of Parliament as unconstitutional
-UC gives rise to unitary setup only
-UC is always flexible because all it takes to change the Constitution is to bring a new law by Parliament
-UC is an evolved one as it is an outcoming/efforts of many bodies over a period of time
-before the Constitution was written, it was decided primarily what should be the theme/objective/purpose of our IC
-Ojective Resolution was the document written by J.L. Nehru that served that basis
-it was moved before the Constituent Assembly where it was voted and accepted upon
-this document serverd as the basis on which the IC was written
-Preamble is the document that forms the summary of the IC
-Chronologically, the order was: Objective Resolution -> IC -> Preamble
-In India, laws that are written in the IC are called Constitutinal laws such as fundamental duties etc
-while laws not a part of the IC called Ordinary laws are inferior to these Constitutional laws, these are MNREGA, CAA etc
-it implies that these laws support the Constitutional ones
-CL are superior to OL because changing them is difficult and they act as a reference
-in U.K., as there's no constitution, every law is equal and holds equal value

Indian Constitution
-IC is divided into parts, which contains articles
-at enactment, it had 22 parts, 395 articles, 8 schedules
-at present, it has 25 parts, 470 articles, 12 schedules
-4 parts[IVA, IXA, IXB, XIVA] were added, 1 part[VII] was repealed
-IVA: Fundamental Duties - Article 51A
-IXA: Municipalities
-IXB: Co-operative societies 
-XIVA: Tribunals - Articles 323A to 323B
-total 104 amendments are made till date
-lastly added IXB by the 97th Amendment

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Constitutionalism
-Constitutionalism means as system with a limited govt. i.e. a governance setup whose powers are not arbitrary or unrestricted i.e. 
it is a system having limited govt. 
-example of max. absence of Constitutionalism are: Hitler from Germany, Saddam Hussain from Iraq, Kim Jong-un from N. Korea, Gaddafi from Libya
-Hitler executed Jews whenever he wanted, Kim executes anybody he feels so
-Unlimited govt. is one which concentrates maximum power of administration in few hands which leads to corruption, violation of human rights
and encroachment/violation on the liberty of common man
-the provisions which ensure Constitutionalism are
-a democratically formed Constitution
-separation of powers(SOP)
-checks and balances
-independent Judiciary
-power of Judicial review
-rule of law, fundamental rights and various tools of transparency like RTI, e-governace etc
-Constitutionalism not only places limits on the powers of administration but it also requires that
people of the society also fulfil their duties and they do not become disrespectful to the laws in the country
-In India, political culture needs to improve with time so that the members of the govt. maintains self discipline and try not to break the law
-even civil society in India is divided on the grounds of religion, race, caste, language etc
-thus they do not put effective check on the govt. which weakens the idea of Constitutionalism

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parliamentry v/s Presidential system of govt.
--Parliamentary
-executive is a part of legislature
-here ministers are from Parliament only, or if not, they must become MP within a fixed time which in case of India is 6 months
-the council of ministers is represented by PM and this body the true executive making all the most important decisions of administration
-the President is the head of the state not having much real executive powers (decision making powers) and he is a nominal (name sake) head of the state 
-the COM is responsible to the LS in case of India
-it puts greater stress on the idea of responsible executive even if it is less stable 
--Presidential
-executive and legislature are two clearly 2 separate bodies
-here ministers are not part of legislature and the President choses his team of ministers from amongst the citizens at large
-President is the real head executive of the state who is also the head of the govt. having a ministerial cell (COM) to assist/guide him
-President and his ministerial cell is not much responsible to the legislature
-it puts greater stress on the idea of a stable executive even if it is less accountable to the legislature

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Separation of Power
-the French philosopher Montesquieu gave the idea of SOP in which 3 organs of the state i.e. legislature, executive and judiciary
shall be separated into water type compartments with an objective of preventing the state from becoming totalitarian (absolutely powerful)
-thus individual liberty can be safeguarded 
-USA was the first nation to implement this idea
-India accepted the idea of SOP in a modified form called the principle of 'Checks and Balances'
where all the 3 organs of the state i.e. legislature, executive and judiciary exercise some form of control over each other
and thus all the three organs maintain a balance among each other and impose responsibility on each other
-India follows Parliamentary system of govt. where executive is a part of legislature and thus pure SOP is not possible
-SC in 1996 declared that the theory of SOP and the basic structure of the Constitution is an integral part of IC
and thus both of them form the elements of basic structure of the IC

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preamble
-Preamble is regarded as the introduction or prelude (beginning) to the Constitution
-it carries the essence/summary of the whole Constitution
-it also contains the basic values which are found in the Constitution
-according to D.D.Basu, it contains the philosophy or the theme of the Constitution
-it contains the key to unravel the minds of Constitution makers and it tells us the intentions 
they had in the mind regarding various provisions of the Constitution
-it is in the form of a declaration but it does not confer any substantive powers on the organs of the govt.
or citizens nor it limits those powers
-it cannot overwrite specific provisions of the Constitution i.e. Preamble is subordinate to Constitution 
if there's a clash btw an article of the Constitution and the Preamble then former shall prevail over the Preamble
-as per SC if there is an ambiguity surrounding an article of the Constitution then that interpretation of the article
may be used by the courts which tallies/matches with the Preamble
-Preamble has an enacting clause where it declares that the Constitution of India was enacted and adopted on 26 Nov. 1949
-Preamble of IC declares that the source of all the powers of the Constitution is the people of India themselves 
i.e. Constitution arises from people only which means that Preamble indicates that people of India are the ultimate
sovereign, however in Keher Singh vs Union of India case 1989, the statement was challenged that Constitution derives 
its powers from people directly, but the court said that this statement that Constitution derives its powers from people 
directly is a legal fiction but it is a conclusive assumption which cannot be tested or challenged in any 
court of law and should be accepted as such 
-Preamble contains the ideals and the aspirations of people of India
-Ideals are the means to achieve the aspirations
-5 ideals mentioned are Sovereignity, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic
-4 aspirations are Liberty, Justice, Equality and Fraternity
-Preamble may help the judiciary in giving the legal interpretation of the Constitutional provisions
Is Preamble part of the Constitution
-the traditional view was that Preamble was not a part of the Constitution because even it is removed from the Constitution, 
the Constitution would continue to function further unlike the Constitution, Preamble does not confer or limit the powers of the organs of the state
and thus Preamble has a very limited role to play in the Constitution. SC in Berubari case 1960 held that Preamble was not a part of the Constitution
but the modern view is that Preamble is considered to be part of the Constitution because only if Preamble is a part of Constitution 
then only it can be amended under Article 368 to maintain a pace with the modern day Constitution and Parliamentary Philosophy, 
therefore SC over wrote its earlier decision in Kesavananda Bharati vs State of Kerala case 1973 that Preamble is a part of Constitution

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sovereignity
-Sovereignity means that the country's govt is totally independent and it does not acknowledge any arbitrary power as supreme with 
regard to the governance of the country either within its boundary or internationally
-in the era of Liberalisation, Privatisation, Globalisation (LPG) when every country is a part of number of International Agreements, treaties
and agencies it is said that countries have lost their freedom to take independent decisions which is a question mark on their soverignity
and India is not an exception, however this argument may not be completely true particularly for India since even in the globalised world
India is taking decisions keeping in mind the highest interest of people of India and its constitutional values and India does not agree to
-India does not give in to any kind of arbitrary pressure, moreover in the National Interest if India has to put its foot down India does so 
whether it was Dokhlam stand off or resisting the American pressure with regard to S400 missiles so largely the global factors have not 
eroded the Sovereinity of India

Secularism
-Secularism means that the state does not acknowledge its closeness with any particular religion i.e. state shall not recognise any particular
religion as the official religion of the country.
-in Indian context, it means state is neither religious nor irreligious/anti-religious rather India is non-religious in character
-in India, all the religion that have made India their home have the right to co-exist in the soil of India
-most of the western countries like France or Germany also maintain a secular orientation since these countries also do not show 
affiliation to any specific religion however unlike India where state promotes all the religions. In the west, state maintains a distance 
from church/religion which means every religion for example- in west, if govt. takes decision, the decisions are taken for their objective
value, however when in India, decisions are taken, the decisions do not ignore the religious sentiments or religious understanding of any religion
-India actively promotes all the religion, whereas in west, state does not invest to promote in religion which includes all the religion
if analysed deeply then the approach of secularism taken up by India is better than the secular approach of the west as it brings more security
and consolation among the people of all the religions as they feel that state is there to protect their religious practices and religious sentiments

Socialism
-Socialism in general means that benefit of the societal resources should reach every member of the society 
and nobody should be left out from enjoying the benefits of the resources. 
-Also concentration of wealth in few hands should be prevented unlike USSR which tried to achieve socialistic goals 
through the model called Marxist Socialism involving complete Nationalisation
-in India we took up the model of Democratic Socialism or Fabian Socialism in which socialistic goals are to be achieved but through Democratic means 
-in which private ownership and private businesses are also allowed besides govt. ownership and govt. enterprises (PSU) 
-it is a case of mixed economy supported by policies like Progressive Taxation, Land Ceiling Act, and govt. run welfare schemes etc

Democracy
-Democracy is a system where people decide regarding the decisions of the govt.
-in this context every member of the society should be allowed to express and be heard while making decisions of governance
so in a way it is governance by the people
-Democracy can be direct where people directly tell about their views regarding particular questions of governance however its not quiet practical 
to implement direct democracy in India because of huge population and a big size of the population being illiterate so we follow indirect democracy 
or representative democracy where people choose their representatives and these representatives take the decisions of governance on the behalf of people
thus incorporating the views and the aspirations of every member of society in the decision making process though indirectly
-Democracy is very crutial for the overall development of the country however certain threats or weaknesses particularly in Indian Democracy
-for example, people choosing wrong representatives to become their voice in the governance system is a big threat however this often happen
-this happens because criminal elements or non serious candidates becoming the voice of people which happens because many of them buy votes
and some are brought to power by the misuse of muscle power
-people voting for parochial factors like religion, race, caste, language, region can also bring wrong representatives to power which can 
weaken democracy
-people not excercising right to vote also weakens democracy
-representatives not communicating with the group they represent also weakens democracy
-however this vacuum can be filled through unbiased media
-however considered the 4th pillar of democracy if becomes biased and corrupt then this can destabilize democracy and encourage people
to take wrong decisions in future also 
-misuse of various laws to suppress political dessent is also a threat to democracy
-political defections for personal benefit will also weaken democracy 
-illiteracy and poverty are also two weaknesses or threat to democracy
--however the ray of hope lies in 
-electoral reforms particularly to fight criminalisation of politics
-making the anti-defection law effective
-fighting fake news
-independent and strong judiciary is a must for democracy
-people voting more in number and voting responsibly will strengthen democracy
-tools of accoutability like RTI and e-governance will also strengthen democracy

Republic
-Republic is a system where people are supreme and even the head of the state is elected by people and there is no hereditary ruler in the country

Aspirations of Preamble
--Justice
-Preamble talks about comprehensive justice i.e. Political, Social and Economic Justice achieved through various provisions of the Constitution like
-Political Justice achieved through right to vote and right to contest in the election under Article 326
-Social Justice achieved through fundamentals rights under Article 14, 15, 17, 18 etc
-Economic Justice achieved through various fundamental rights like right to vocation or various directive principles
--Liberty
-Liberty is the absence of arbitrary powers exercised by an individual or an institution against other individuals or group thereby allowing
the individual or the group an opportunity to grow or achieve their full potential  
--Equality
-Preamble talks about equality of opportunity and equality of status
--Fraternity
-Fraternity is a sense of brotherhood that prevails among all the people of India which is very essential to promote the unity and integrity of India
and save the dignity of individual

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part II - Citizenship [Articles 5-11]

-A Citizen is an individual who enjoys the full membership of the country and he enjoys all the rights available in the country
-there are some rights in India which are reseverd for Indian citizens only for example- the right under Article 15, 16, 19, 29, 30, 326 etc
-the IC does not lay down permanent or detailed provisions regarding the citizenship in India 
-Part 2 of the IC simply describes the classes of persons who would deamed to be the citizen of India at the commencement of the Constitution
and has the detailing of the laws regarding citizenship onto Parliament
-Article 11 of the IC confers the powers onto the Parliament to make laws on Citizenship and using this power Parliament enacted Indian Citizenship Act 1955
which provides for the acquisition and termination of Indian Citizenship
-the IC provides only for single citizenship and prohibits dual 
-Indian Citizenship Act 1955 is based on 2 legal principles
--1st is Jus Soli i.e. law of soil 
--2nd is Jus Sanguine i.e. law of blood

Indian Citizenship Act 1955 as amended from time to time provides for 5 ways through which 1 can acquire the Indian Citizenship
1. Citizenship by birth
-a person born in India >= 26 Jan 1950 and < 1 July 1987 is a citizen of India by birth irrespective of the Nationality of his parents
-a person born in India >= 1 July 1987 and < 3 Dec 2004 is a citizen of India by birth if either of his parents is a citizen of India at the time of his birth
-a person born in India >= 3 Dec 2004 is a citizen of India by birth if both the parents are citizen of India at the time of birth or if only 1 parent is 
India citizen the other must not be illegal migrant at the time of birth
--illegal migrant is a foreigner who entered India without a valid passport or proper documentation 

2. Citizenship by descent
-a person born outside India >= 26 Jan 1950 and < 10 Dec 1992 is a citizen of India by descent if his father was citizen of India at the time of his birth
-a person born outside India >= 10 Dec 1992 and < 3 Dec 2004 is a citizen of India by descent if either of his parents was citizen of India at the time of his birth
-a person born outside India >= 3 Dec 2004 is a citizen of India by descent if either of his parents was citizen of India at the time of his birth, and parents
give an undertaking that the minor does not hold the passport of any other country and his birth must be registered at an Indian Counulate withing 1 year of birth

3. Incorporation of territory
-when a new territory is acquired by India then the individuals living there can have an option of adopting Indian Citizenship

--all the above three categories of citizens are referred as Natural Born Citizens

4. Citizenship through Registration
-Indian citizenship through Registration can be acquired by an eligible applicant for example- 
--a citizen of a commonwealth country
--a foreigner who married Indian citizen
--minor child of Indian parents etc
-who is ordinarily residing in India for 7 years before making the application
-of these 7 years, 1 year before he applies for the citizenship he must be living in India continuosly for 1 year
and 8 years previous to that, his total stay in India must be minimum 6 years
-for OCI, the period of stay in India is 1 year	

5. Citizenship through Naturalisation
-it can be acquired by foreigners who are ordinarily residing in India for 12 years
-of these 12 years, he must be living in India continuously for 1 year before making the application and his stay in India
14 years previous to this 1 year comes out to be of minimum 11 years

Loss of Indian Citizenship

1. Renunciation 
-it is a volunatary act on the part of Indian Citizen who wants to surrender his Indian Citizenship 
-Govt. of India may or may not accept the application of renunciation

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Federal vs Unitary
-In a federal system, 2 forms of govt. co-exist and none is inferior to other as both derive their powers from Constitution itself
-in a federal system, Constitution has to be written and it should divide the powers between Center and States and this division of powers 
btw Center and States is binding upon both the Center as well as the States i.e. Constitution is supreme, also Federal Constitution are difficult
to amend i.e. they are rigid by nature, this way the division of power btw Center and the States can be protected from any undue/unrequired change
either by Center alone or by State alone rather if Constitution needs to be amended it must be amended with the mutual concent of both Center and States
-in federal system to maintain the division of power btw Center and State and resolve the disputes over the division power btw them there must be an 
independent arbitrator who must also have the power to interpret the Constitution, for ex - in India, Supreme Court is one such power
-US, Australia, Canada

-In Unitary system, there exists 1 supreme govt. i.e. at Center though State governments are there but they are only the administrative arms of Center
working as per directions of Center
-in Unitary system, Constitution may be written or unwritten
-Unitarty system will have a flexible Constitution which can be changed by Parliament alone 
-in Unitary system, Judiciary may not be that powerful, particularly with respect to its jurisdiction on the areas related to distribution of powers
btw Center and States
-France, Britain

Nature of Indian Federal Constitution
-experts believe that IC is federal, though some believe it is not truly federal rather it is quasi-federal or a federation with bias towards Unitarism
-howerver SC said that whatever is the degree of federalism in IC, federalism is the part of basic structure of the IC
-due to the following features, we can conclude that IC is a federal Constitution or atleast near to it
1. Written Constitution
-a federal Constitution necessarily is a written Constitution and since India has a written Constitution, it supports the case of India being federal
2. Division/Distribution of Power
-in a federal system, there are 2 forms of govt. i.e. Center and States, and none is sub-ordinate to other as both derives their powers from the Constitution
and both are supreme in their respective area of activity and act like coordinating bodies
3. Supremacy of Constitution 
-in a federal context, Constitution is binding upon Center and the State governments and both have to respect it and perform only those functions which are 
allowed under the Constitution 
4. Rigidity of Constitution
-federal Constitution is rigid atleast in some areas which deal with distribution of powers btw Center and States
-IC is a mix of being rigid and flexible but it is rigid i.e. difficult to amend particularly on those parts which affect the distribution of powers btw
Center and the States, for ex- under Article 368 the procedure to amend the Constitution in the following 5 areas is quiet difficult i.e. Constitution is rigid
in these 5 areas because these amendments are to be first passed by Parliament that too by a majority of not less than 2/3rd of the members present and voting
and the majority of total membership of the house after which atleast 50% of the State Legislative Bodies need to approve the amendment before it is sent to 
the President for his assent, other than these 5 areas, other amendments in the Constitution are simply approved by the Parliament by special majority and 
States are not involved
5. Authority of Courts
-to resolve the disputes that may arise btw Center and the States over distribution of Powers, there must be an authority independent of both and that authority 
should also have the power to interpret the Constitution, such an authority in India is a SC of India indicating that India is federal 

Distinctive nature of Indian Federal System (here we are proving that India is a Unitary)

1. Single Citizenship, Single Constitution, Single Judiciary
-US and Australia are seen as benchmark of a federal system, for ex- US has got a system in which there is a Constitution dealing with the federal administration
and also States have their own Constitution, US has a dual Judicial system in which States have their own SC and their is a SC of US which does not have 
administrative control over the States Judiciary, US system allows dual citizenship in which an individual is not only the citizen of the country but also 
he belongs to a state as a citizen, however IC possesses certain essential features of a federal system yet it differs much from the typical federal model 
followed in typical federal countries, for ex- in India, States do not have their respective Constitution, their is no dual citizenship, there is a single
Judicial system across India

2. Under Article 3 of the IC, Parliament can change the name, area, or boundary of any State with or even without the consent of the state i.e. in India, States
do not enjoy a permanent independent identity which is a deviation from understanding about federal systems of the world

3. during normal situations in India, Center and States work according to their Constitutionally guaranteed powers i.e. distribution of power exist btw Center
and States, however during emergency this distribution of power shifts in the favour of Center making India appear Unitary, this is seen as a big flaw/weakness
in Indian federal system as it has no fixed character, however it is not so in reality having flexibility in our federal design is the requirement of
realities of India, for ex- India has to be federal specifically because of the reasons of cultural and geographical diversities as well as political 
and historical reasons required India to allow the States to have autonomy/powers in some areas, however India also has to have a Unitary touch in its 
federal polity particularly during the times of crisis or emergency because of the fact that in many states there exists a tendency to break away which is
further fueled by the presence of hostile neighbours, Center also has to be more dominant for the reason Center can bring oneness across all the states of 
India inspite of huge cultural diversities and conflict for resources among the states keeping India united

4. Schedule 7 of the IC distributes the legislative powers btw Center and the States making India appear federal however this distribution is largely in the favour 
of Center for the following reasons 
a. the union list not only has more subjects but they are more critical also by nature and these subjects allow Center to raise more revenue 
b. the law made by Center has jurisdiction across India whereas the law made by States on the subjects of State list apply locally 
c. even on concurrent list the claim of Center is prior and superior 
d. the subjects of State list are not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the States i.e. even Center can very well interfere in these areas, for ex under
the following 5 extra-ordinary conditions Parliament can legislate/make laws over the subjects of State list 
i. under Article 249 if RS passes a resolution by a majority of not less than 2/3rd of the members present and voting that it is urgently in National Interest
for the Parliament to legislate over specified subjects of the State list then Parliament assumes the legislative jurisdiction over those specified subjects 
of the State list. the valididy of such a law can be min 0.5 year and max 1.5 years [keyword: Rajya Sabha, National Interest] 
ii. under Article 250 during National Emergency, Parliament assumes concurrent legislative jurisdiction over the subjects under State's list
this law if made by Parliament shall expire after 6 months from the date emergency comes to an end
iii. under Article 252 if 2 or more than 2 State Legislatures pass a resolution authorizing the Parliament to legislate over specified subjects of the State list
then Parliament assumes the jurisdiction over those subjects for those States and the law shall remain valid till the time it is repelled by the Parliament 
iv. under Article 253, Parliament can pass a law on a subject of State list with or without the consent of the State for implementation of International Treaties 
v. under Article 356, when President's rule is imposed in a State and the State Assembly is suspended/dissolved then Parliament gets exclusive legislative 
jurisdiction with respect to the subjects of the State list for the concerned State

5. under Article 248, the residuary power of legislation belongs to Parliament 

6. under Article 155, Governor of a State is appointed by the President and he holds during the pleasure of President which means that Governor who is the 
head of the State comes under the influence of the Center and through the office of Governor, Center can influence the State

7. Comptroller and Auditor General of India carries the audit of accounts for both the Union and the State Govts, he is appointed by the President and removed
by him with the approval of Parliament. Thus many a times States complain about the biased nature of working of this office 

8. Under Article 312, RS can authorise the Parliament to create 1 or more All India Services, AIS officers are apppointed by Center but they come under overall 
disciplinary control of Center, though they largely function in the senior positions under the State Govt. and by controlling AIS, center can influence the States

9. Under Article 256/257, Center can issue administrative directions to the States including the directions indicating the manner in which Railway properties and
other means of communication shall be maintained, these directions are binding on the States and if not followed then Center can dismiss the State govts. under
Article 365

10. Unequal representation given to States in RS depending upon the population of the States besides 12 nominees of the President in RS i.e. Council of States
is a clear violation of federal principle, for ex- the American federation gives equal representation to all the States in the Senate

Conclusion - On the account of all the above points we can conclude that Indian Federal Structure has a strong unitary bias and thus Indian Federation 
is sometimes referred as Federation Suigeneris. Dr BR Ambedkar said that rigidity and legalism are 2 serious weaknesses of a federal system thus rather than 
declaring India Federation of States, India was declared as Union of States

Fundamental Duties : Part IVA of the IC
-part IV A of the IC made part of IC through 42nd amendment act 1976 inspired by Const. of USSR and based on the recommendation of Sardar Swarn Singh committee, 1976 
-Article 51A mentions 11 fundamental duties of every Indian Citizen
-51A(a): to abide by Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, National flag and Anthem 
-51A(b): to cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired the Indian struggle for freedom
-51A(c): to uphold and protect the sovereignity, unity and integrity of India
-51A(d): to defend the country and render National service when called upon to do so 
-51A(e): to promote harmony and spirit of common brotherhood among all the people of India and renounce the practices derrogatory against to the dignity of women
-51A(f): to value and preseve the rich heritage of our composite culture 
-51A(g): to protect and improve natural environment and have compassion for living creatures 
-51A(h): to develop scientific temper, humanism and spirit of inquiry and reform
-51A(i): to safeguard public property and give up violence 
-51A(j): try to excel in all the spheres of individual and collective activities so that Nation constantly rises 
-51A(k): introduced through 86th amendment act 2002 under which it is a duty of every parent or guardian to provide opportunity for education to his child/ward(6-14y)

-IC does not carry the provision for direct enforcement of these duties i.e. there is no sanction/punishment to prevent their violation, however Parliament can 
enforce them by making a suitable legislation, Fundamental Duties are also referred to understand the limits on Fundamental Rights
-SC clarified that FD apply on States also because State is a reflection of citizen only 
-FD simply added in the IC may not achieve their real goal of making the people responsible rather people should be made aware about these duties proactively
along with changing the value system in the society in which we put the Nation first and not the familiy or the individual first

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part III - Fundamental Rights [Articles 12-35] 

-US was the first country to give a Constitutional status to a set of Rights called Fundamental Rights
-FR in the IC are largely inspired by the Bill of Rights in the American Constitution
-the rights given in part III of the IC are called Fundamental not only because they are provided by the fundamental law of the land i.e. Constitution but also
because these rights prevent the State from becoming arbitrary or authoritarian and thus they are fundamental for the creation of a civilised society 
-FRs are also fundamental because they are the most important assets with an individual to achieve his fullest physical, intellectual and spiritual potential/growth
-these rights are also quite fundamental for the healthy functioning of Democracy and thus FRs are referred as corner stone(identification) of Indian Democracy
-Part III and Part IV of the IC together constitute the conscience of the Constitution or the intellectual component of the Constitution

Difference btw Fundamental Rights and Ordinary Legal Rights 
-while OLR are enforced and protected by Ordinary Law of the land, FR are protected and guaranteed by the Constitution of the country itself
-in case of violation of FRs, the agrieved can approach the SC directly whereas if an OLR is violated then the agrieved gets the relief by approaching 
the sub-ordinate courts or by High Court but he cannot directly approach SC
-OLR can be changed by legislature through an ordinary process of law making however FRs can be changed only by amending the Constitution under Article 368

Nature of Fundamental Rights
-FRs are not absolute in nature since they are subject to reasonable restrictions and responsibilies attached to them 
-FRs provide protection to an individual primarily against State's action however few FRs are available against the State as well as against private individuals
for ex- Right against untouchability, Right to life, Right against exploitation

Doctrine of Eclipse
-under Article 13(1), all the laws enforced in India before the commencement of the Constitution shall be unconstitutional and void, if they violate 1 or more
than 1 provisions of part 3 of the Constitution i.e. Fundamental Rights, to the extent of such violation 
-in Bhikaji Narayan vs State of M.P. case 1955, SC applied the principle of Eclipse and said that such a pre-constitutional law if important enough can be given
protection under Doctrine of Eclipse i.e. the law can be put in the shadow of FRs rather than being declared unconstitutional because of which the law will 
remain inactive i.e. dormant and in the future if any amendment is able to end the clash btw the law and the FR then this law can be revived again
and made enforceable and till the time the law can be applied on the people whose FRs are not being violated by this law
-in Deepchand vs State of U.P. case 1959, SC held that Doctrine of Eclipse can be applied only to a pre-constitutional law and not to a post-constitutional law
as the post-constitutional law which violates the FR is invalid Ab initio, thus a post-constitutional law deserves no protection under Doctrine of Eclipse
-in Ambika Mills vs State of Gujrat case 1974, SC held by overuling its earlier judgement in Deepchand case that Doctrine of Eclipse can be applied to protect 
not only a pre-constitutional law but also a post-constitutional law

Amendability of Fundamental Rights
-Article 13(2) says that State shall not make any 'LAW' that takes away or abridges/reducing importance 1 or more FRs and if such a law is 
passed, then the law shall be unconstitutional and void to the extent of the inconsistency
-However seemingly against the provisions of Article 13(2), 
--the first amendment act 1951 introduced Article 15(4) which was apparently against the spirit of Article 15. 
--the first amendment act also amended Article 19(6) through which reasonal restrictions were put on Right to Vocation. 
--the first amendment act also introduced the 9th Schedule to the Constitution which took away the powers of Judicial review of the courts 
i.e. the laws added in the 9th Schedule were supposed not to be questioned in the court on the ground that the law was violative of FRs
-now the first amendment act was challenged before SC in Shankari Prasad vs Union of India case 1951, but the ruling came in the favour of Parliament 
-SC declared in the case that Parliament enjoys 2 types of legislative powers, first Ordinary legislative powers, and second Constitutional legislative powers
under Article 368. If Parliament makes use of Constitutional powers under Article 368 then the outcome is Constitutional Amendment which is not covered in the
ambit of 'LAW' as defined under Article 13(3) and thus will not be a violation of Article 13(2), however if Parliament excercises Ordinary legislative powers
then the result is 'LAW' as defined under Article 13(3) which comes under the scope Article 13(2) and would be void if it goes against 1 or more FRs
thus in Shankari Prasad Case, SC held that Parliament under Article 368 can amend any part of the IC including FRs
-in Golakhnath vs State of Punjab Case 1967, SC overuled its earlier decision and held that Article 368 contains only the procedure to amend the Constitution but
it does not confer the power upon the Parliament to amend the Constitution and thus Parliament cannot amend any part of the Constitution including FRs
-however Parliament responded by passing 24th amendment act 1971 which amended the title of Article 368 which now reads 'The Procedure to amend the Constitution
and the Power to amend the Constitution'
-in Keshavanand Bharati vs State of Kerala Case 1973, the 24th amendment act which amended the title of Article 368 was challenged among other things but the SC
upheld the Constitutional validity of 24th amendment act and declared that Parliament by the virtue of its powers under Article 368 can amend any part of the IC
under Article 368 including the amendments in FRs, however no amendment should disturb the basic structure of the IC
-however SC didn't define what the Basic Structure(BS) of the IC was, however in number of cases the Judiciary has been indicating those parts of the Constitution
which form the BS of the IC
-BS includes those provisions of the IC without which the IC may loose its basic character/nature, for ex- it includes 
--Supremacy of Constitution
--Rule of law
--SOP
--Checks & Balances 
--federalism 
--Judicial Review
--Independence of Judiciary 
--Socialism 
--Soveriegnity of India 
--Access to Justice 
--Unity & Integrity of India 
--Mandate/Purpose/Agenda to build a Welfare State etc.

-Clubbed all the FRs together depending upon their similar nature in 6 broad categories
1. FRs related to Equality - Article 14 to Article 18
2. FRs related to Freedom  - Article 19 to Article 22
3. FRs against Exploitation - Article 23 and Article 24
4. FRs related to Religion - Article 25 to Article 28
5. FRs related to Cultural & Educational Rights - Article 29 and Article 30
6. FRs related to Constitutional Remedies - Article 32
--[trick : 5 4 2 4 2 1]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 13 - No law shall be made that violates FR

Article 13(1)
-all the laws enforced in India before the commencement of the Constitution shall be unconstitutional and void, if they violate 1 or more
than 1 provisions of part 3 of the Constitution i.e. Fundamental Rights, to the extent of such violation

Article 13(2)
-State shall not make any 'LAW' that takes away or abridges/reducing importance 1 or more FRs and if such a law is 
passed, then the law shall be unconstitutional and void to the extent of the inconsistency

Article 13(3)
-the expression "law" includes any Ordinance, order, bye-law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usage having the force of law 
in the territory of India or any part thereof

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 14 : Right to Equality
-it states that The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India 

a. Equality before Law
-Equality before law is a concept which originated in England
-it is a negatively worded idea because 'Absense of privileges enjoyed by an individual in the eyes of law i.e. all persons irrespective of their rank or position
are equal before law and they shall be treated equally'
-this means that all persons are subject to the ordinary jurisdiction of court i.e. all can sue or can get sued before the ordinary court
-so Article 14 guarantees only jurisdictory(legal) equality and not complete equality
-however there are few exceptions to the concept of Equality before law
--the President or the Governor of the State is not answerable to the Court of law for discharging his official functions
--no criminal case can be started or continued against the President/Governor
--no civil case where relief is demanded can be started against the President or Governor without giving them a prior notice of 2 months 
--privileges given to legislators or protection given to diplomats are also exceptions to Equality before law

-Rule of Law
-the concept originated in England and is an integral part of the idea called Equality before Law i.e. EBL gives rise to ROL
-ROL means that law is Supreme i.e. Lex Supremus and there is absolute supremacy of regular law of the country as opposed to the influence of any arbitrary power
-with the adoption of ROL, the concept of administration has changed from Rex Lex(King is Law) to Lex Rex(Law is King)
-this is very essential to maintain order and stability in the society
-SC declared that ROL is so essential for healthy functioning of a civilised society that it is a component of basic structure of the IC
-ROL has 3 principles
1. no man can be punished or made to suffer except for violation of law and such a violation shall also be established/proven in the ordinary court of land
2. all persons are subject to the ordinary law of land without distinction
3. the 3rd principle of ROL as applicable in India is a modification of the 3rd principle of ROL of England which says in India, Constitution is the Supreme
Law of land and all the laws passed by the legislature must be consistent with the provisions of the IC

b. Equal Protection of Law
-the concept originated in USA, it is a positive concept which means Equality of treatment in Equal circumstances i.e. like should be treated alike 
-Equality does not mean uniform application of law under all circumstances but it means before applying the law situational variation must be taken into account
thus Article 14 guarantees Equality but only among Equals, thus Equal Protection of Law allows for what is called as Positive Discrimination/Protective Discrimation
under which even the Reservation Policy is valid

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 15 : Right against Discrimination

Aritcle 15(1) 
-State shall not discriminate against citizen only on the ground of Religion, Race, Caste, Sex, Place of Birth or any of them i.e.
-these conditions alone are not sufficient grounds to have discrimination done under Equal Protection of Law but these conditions must be accompanied with 
some other factors or circumstances to bring Positive Discrimination, for ex - when a caste is given Reservation then it is not because of the caste per say
rather it is because of the Backwardness attached with the caste

Article 15(2)
-prohobits State and Individual both from discriminating against citizens only on the ground of Religion, Race, Caste, Sex, Place of Birth or any of them in having
access to Public Places such as parks, hotels, hospitals, or wells, tanks, ghats, road maintained out of State's fund
-the right under Article 15(2) is fighting various social evils like Untouchability, Communalism, Racial Bias, Gender Discrimination, Regionalism etc.

Article 15(3)
-State is allowed to make special provisions for Women and Children

Article 15(4)
-introduced through 1st Amendment Act 1951
-State can make special provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or SCs and STs

Article 15(5)
-introduced through 93rd Amendment Act 2005, which empowers the State to make special provisions for the admission of backward classes of citizens in 
educational institutions whether public or private aided or unaided except minorities educational institutions

Article 15(6)
-introduced through 103rd Amendment Act 2019
-provides for Reservation upto 10% for economically weaker section in educational institutions whether public or private, aided or unaided except 
minority educational institutions

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 16 - Equal Opportunity in Public Employment

Article 16(1)
-Provides for equality of opportunity to all the sections of citizens in public employment

Article 16(2)
-Prohibits State from discrimination against citizens only on the ground of Religion, Race, Caste, Sex, Place of Birth, Residence, Descent or any of them in gaining
public employment

Article 16(3)
-Parliament is empowered to provide by law , Residence as a ground or qualification to gain certain categories of public employment

Article 16(4)
-empowers the State to make special provisions in the favour of backward classes of citizens in reserving the posts of the nature of public employment 
if the backward class is not adequately represented in the services under the State and the said class of citizens is also socially and educationally backward
-SC in Indira Sawhney vs Union of India Case 1992, held that 
a. 27% reservation for OBCs in public jobs was constitutionally valid, however SC directed the State to identify the creamy layer among the OBCs and remove
them from the benefit of reservation
b. Court held that ordinarily reservation in the favour of backward classes shall not exceed 50% of the total seats 
c. SC also held that reservation should be a one-time benefit which can be availed at entry level only so SC declared the reservation given to SC/ST in promotion
to be unconstitutional and void 
d. to this, Parliament reacted by introducing Article 16(4A) through 77th Amendment Act 1995 which provided for Reservation in Promotion to SC/ST
e. As per the recent judgement of SC in State of Punjab vs Davinder Singh Case 2020, respective State legislatures can create sub-quota within the reserved quota
for SC/ST

Article 16(5) 
-it empowers the State to prescribe religion as a ground or qualification for the recruitment of candidates in certain categories of public employment

Article 16(6)
-introduced through 103rd Amendment Act 2019
-empowers the State to reserve upto 10% of seats for Economically Weaker Sections in public employment 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 17 - Abolition of Untouchability
-it provides a Fundamental Right against Untouchability in absolute terms without limitation or exception 
-neither Constitution  or Parliamentary laws defines untouchability but Judiciary has defined it as a social practice where a person only on the basis of his birth
in a particular caste is looked down upon and discriminated wrongly
-SC expanded the definition by declaring that any practice in which an individual or a group is considered polluted or impure and discriminated will also amount 
to practice of untouchability
-Untouchability Offenses Act 1955 which prescribed for the punishment for practicing untouchability has been renamed and strenghthened as Civil Rights (Proctection)
Act 1976

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 18 - Abolition of Titles

Article 18(1)
-Prohibits the State from conferring any title except for Military or Academic distinction
-National awards also called as Padma Awards, started in 1954 are regarded as decorations or awards and not titles and therefore the awardee is not suppose to use
them as a prefix or suffix with their name
-SC held that National Awards are not violative of Principle of Equality because Right to Equality does not mandate that merit should not be recognised

Article 18(2)
-prohibits the citizen of India from accepting any title from a Foreign State

Article 18(3)
-a foreigner holding any office of profit or trust under Indian State cannot accept any title from a Foreign State without the concent of the President

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 19 - Fundamental Freedoms

Article 19(1)(a)
-guarantees to all citizens a fundamental right to speech and expression
-after Article 21, Article 19(1)(a) has undergone the most liberal interpretation at the hands of SC
-SC held that the Right under Article 19(1)(a) is an inalienable adjunct to Right to life
-Right to Speech & Expression can have the following meanings 
1. SC held that National flag hoisting is a way to express one's feelings towards the country and is thus a FR under Article 19(1)(a)
2. Participation in Sports is an expression of ones self and is thus a FR
3. Article 19(1)(a) not only gives a Right to Citizen to express his own views and opinions but also to express others views and opinions as a FR and from this
has originated the idea of Freedom of Press
4. The Right also includes Right to Political Dessent i.e. Right to Differ from the views of the govt., this relates to the development of multi-party Democracy
5. SC held that Right to have Information is a FR under Article 19(1)(a) as it helps expression however it is the RTI Act 2005 which tells the procedure to 
access the Information
6. Freedom of Speech & Expression is not limited by the boundaries of the country and a citizen enjoys the right even while travelling abroad, this Right is not
an absolute right rather a restricted right which can be restricted on the ground of security of India, friendly relations with other countries, morality and 
decency of the society, defamation, contempt of court etc.

Article 19(1)(b)
-guarantees a FR to assemble to all the citizens including Right to hold meetings or taking out procession but in a peaceful way

Article 19(1)(c)
-guarantees a FR to form associations of any type, this includes Right to form Political Associations, Right to form Trade Union, Right to form Cooperative Society
-Right to form Cooperative Society as a FR was introduced through 97th Amendment Act, 2011
-Formation of Trade Union is a FR but it does not imply a FR to strike, so Right to Strike may be a legal right but now a funamental right
-SC in 1998 held 'Bandh' to be illegal as it involves an element of coersion and it brings complete shutdown of business and disturbs public life 
-Article 33 of the IC empowers the Parliament to impose restrictions on the Fundamental Rights (except Article 20 and 21) available to Security Forces in the
interest of Security of India, thus Parliament through various laws like Army Act, Navy Act, Police Act, etc has denied the Right to form Political Association
to the Armed Forces

Article 19(1)(d)
-guarantees a FR to movement throughout India however the free movement of citizens can be restricted on the ground of Security of India, Public Order, Interest of 
Scheduled Tribes, Health etc

Article 19(1)(e)
-there is a FR of Residence and Settlement available to Indian Citizens

Article 19(1)(f)
-Right to Property has been removed from Part 3 through 44th Amendment Act 1978 and made a Right in Part 12 of Constitution under Article 300A

Article 19(1)(g)
-guarantees a FR to Vocation i.e. a Profession or a Trade of one's choice however State can impose restrictions on Vocations in the form of Qualifications
in certain profession in Public Interest, moreover State can even take over a business or a trade partially or completely provided it is in Public Interest

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 20

Article 20(1)
-State is prohibited from enacting ex-Post facto criminal legislation
-ex-Post facto legislation means enacting a law and giving it a restrospective effect
-under this Article, no man shall be convicted and sentenced for an act which was not a criminal act at the time of its commissioning

Article 20(2)
-State is prohibited from practicing Double Jeopardy
-Double Jeopardy means no person shall be punished more than once in a court of law for commissioning of a single offence

Article 20(3)
-State is prohibited from compelling an individual to give self-incriminating evidence

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 21
-guarantees to all individuals Right to Life and Liberty
-no person can be deprived of his life or liberty, except according to the procedures established by law (P.E.B.L)

Procedures Established By Law (P.E.B.L)
-the concept originated in England
-under this doctrine when a person is deprived of his life or liberty then the court will examine
1. is there a law in existence which authorizes the executive to deprive the individual of his life and liberty 
2. further the court will examine, was the law made by Competent Authority or not 
3. if Yes, were all the set procedures followed correctly while making the law
-the court however will not examine the fairness of the law or the motive behind the law and thus court cannot declare a law unconstitutional
-this doctrine of P.E.B.L relies more on good sense of legislature and the strength of public opinion in the country
-thus P.E.B.L provides protection to an individual only against the arbitrary action of the executives and not that of legislature

Due Process of Law (D.P.L)
-the concept originated in U.S.A 
-it confers greater power to the Judiciary under which in the case of violation of Article 21, Judiciary will check all the 3 points which it checked under P.E.B.L
as well as it will see whether the law itself is fair and just or not by applying the Principles of Natural Justice 
-thus D.P.L provides protection to an individual both against the arbitrary action of Executive as well as Legislature
-our Constitution under Article 21 provides only for P.E.B.L, however SC in Maneka Gandhi Case 1978 interpreted Article 21 to include the Doctrine of D.P.L by 
reading incorporation of Principles of Natural Justice in Article 21

Principles of Natural Justice
1. no body should be punished unheard
2. no body must be judge of his own case
3. Authority must act Bonafide/neutral
-the purpose of these principles is to exclude the chances of arbitrariness in decision making and they aim at humanising decision making process as their
focus is on the fact that every action must be supported by a justified reason 
-accoring to SC, these principles are Universal i.e. they are binding on all authorities including Judiciary, private individuals and all other organisations
-SC declared that these principles even if not explicitly mentioned in the IC, they can be found under Article 14 and Article 21 of the IC implicitly
-they are so important for orderly functioning of the State that they are regarded as part of Basic Structure of the IC

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 21A
-introduced through 86th Amendment Act 2002, under which State shall provide Free and Compulsory Education to all children of age 6-14 as provided by law
-thus it is a FR of every child of age 6-14 to get free education which can be enforced upon State
-Compulsory Education will not only be the responsibility of State but of Parents also 
-thus a Fundamental Duty was also introduced under Article 51A(k) under which it is the duty of every parent or guardian to send the child to 
educational institution if he is of the age group 6-14

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 22
-it extends protection to an individual during Arrest and Detention, however Article 22 does not guarantee a Fundamental Right against Arrest & Detention rather
it only provides protection to an individual if he is being Arrested or Detained
-it comes into play after Arrest not before Arrest
-it confers 3 Rights to an individual who is being Arrested or Detained
1. No person who is Arrested shall be detained in Custody without informing him of the ground of his Arrest, moreover he shall be entitled to consult a lawyer
of his choice, SC in 1994 held that an arrested person has a Right to have his family, friend or relative informed about his arrest so he is able to defend himself
Court also held that the person shall not be arrested merely on the ground of suspicion and his arrest must be recorded in the official diary 
2. the arrested person shall be produced before the nearest Judicial Magistrate withing 24 hours of arrest excluding the time of journey
3. no person shall be detained in custody beyond the period which was authorized by the Magistrate 
-the protections under Article 22 are not available to enemy aliens or the persons arrested under Preventive Detention Laws 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 23 - Right against Exploitation

Article 23(1)
-prohibits traffic in human beings, begars and other forms of forced labour

Article 23(2)
-empowers the State to compel the individual to provide service with or without payment provided it is in Public Interest 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 24 - Prohibits Child Labour
-Children age less than 14 years are prohibited from being employed in hazardous employments
-an amendment was made in the act as Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act 2016, which says
--Complete prohibition of employment of children below the age of 14
--Children below the age of 14 years will be allowed to work in Family Business/Enterprises only if they are non-hazardous that too after school hours or vacations
--Children between 14-18 years are categorised as Adolescents and are not allowed to work in hazardous occupations

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 25
-guarantees to all individuals, a two fold freedom of Religion which includes
--Right to freedom of Conscience
--Right to Profess, Practice, Propagate

a. Right to freedom of Conscience
-it means absolute inner freedom of an individual to mould his religious belief and faith 
-when this inner freedom takes an outward expression, it is called Right to Profess, Practice and Propogate a religion of ones choice
-SC cleared here religion means faith and not necessarily belief in God 

b. Right to Profess
-it means right of an individual to spell out his religious beliefs freely and openly 

c. Right to Practice 
-it means right of an individual to follow the rituals prescribed by ones religion and display the symbols and the signs associated with his religion
-eg. Muslim women wearing hijab or burkah, Sikh man wearing turban, Hindu man wearing Sacred thread

d. Right to Propagate
-it means right to spell out ones religious teachings for edification of others
-eg. writing a book on my religion, holding religious gathering, conducting religious seminars 

-In father Stanislaus vs State of M.P. Case 1977, SC clarified that a FR of a person to spread his religion by explaining the content cannot be questioned
however there is no FR to convert others to ones own religion, court also clarified that with respect to religious faith and belief, the FR enjoyed by the
individual is absolute and State cannot interfere in it, however in the case of religious conduct and practice the State is free to regulate it in the interest
of Public at large
-you can convert others to your religion but converting others to your religion is not your Fundamental Right
-converting them to your religion by force or temptation is a crime

Note - Religion is not only about God, it is about faith, faith can be in God or not-in-God(Athiest)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 26
-Deals with freedom of religion denomination(group) to manage their religious affairs subject to Public Order, Morality, Health
-it also allows a religious denomination to own and acquire property and administer it as per law
-it also allows a religious denomination to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Article 27
-it truly spells out the secular character of Indian State
-it prohibits the State from spending tax-collection for the promotion and maintenance of any particular religious denomination
-though it does not prohibit the State from spending the tax-collections for the promotion and maintenance of all religions without any discrimination 
-similarly it does not prohibit the State from spending non tax-collection collected in the form of fee or donations in spending for the promotion and maintenance
even of a particular religion

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 28
-Deals with imparting religious instructions in educational institutions.
-it divides all educational institutions into 4 categories
1. EI wholly owned & administered by State
2. EI which are private owned but aided & recognised by State
3. EI which are private owned but unaided though recognised by State
4. EI which are administerd by State but established through religious endowments or charitable trust

-in the 1st category, no religious instruction whatsoever can be imparted
-in the 2nd & 3rd category, religious educational instructions can be imparted however students cannot be compelled to attend those religious instructions

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 29 - Protection of Interest of Minorities

Article 29(1)
-any section of Indian citizens residing in India having a distinct language, script, culture of their own shall have a right to conserve them

Note - though the title of Article 29 is a protection of the Interest of Minorities, yet the language of Article 29(1) extends this right to all the sections of 
citizens who are resident of India

Article 29(2)
-no citizen shall be denied admission in any educational institution maintained by State or recieving aid out of State's fund only on the ground of religion, 
race, caste, language or any of them

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 30
-it deals with the fundamental right of minority community to establish and adminster Educational Institutions
-it classifies minorities on the basis of Religion or Language

Note
-Religious minorities are identified at the National level
-eg. Hindus being in minority in States of Kashmir, Nagaland etc are not considered religious minorities because they are not minorities at the National level
-Linguistic minorities are identified at both the National and State level
-eg. Christians are liguistic majority in Nagaland at State level, while are linguistic minority at the National level

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 32 - Right to Constitutional Remedies
-it confers the power of SC to issue appropriate orders, directions or writs in case FRs are found violated so that FRs can be enforced 
-it also allows the individuals to directly approach the SC in case of violation of FRs, thus Article 32 contains the legal remedy in case FRs of an individual 
are violated 
-thus Article 32 makes other FRs real and enforceable, it provides teeth to other FRs to bite
-without Article 32, one may not be able to enjoy other FRs also and thus it is very important for healthy functioning of Democracy
-Dr Ambedkar described Article 32 as a Heart & Soul of the whole Constitution

Article 32(2)
-it is the Writ Jurisdiction(the power to issue Writ) of SC
-IC provides the Writ Jurisdiction to SC under Article 32 and High Courts under Article 226, this concept of Writ Jurisdiction has been adopted from England 
-Writ Jurisdiction enables the court to issue appropriate writs for the enforcement of rights of an individual 
-Writ Jurisdictin also implicitly confers the power of Judicial Review on SCs or HCs

Article 32(3)
-under this, Parliament has the power to confer Writ Jurisdiction by means of law to any other body 
-using the power, Parliament enacted administrative tribunals act 1985 which conferred the writ jurisdiction on to bodies like 
C.A.T(Center Administrative Tribunals), S.A.T(State Administrative Tribunals), J.A.T(Joint Administrative Tribunals)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Types of Writs

1. Habeas Corpus (Great Writ)
-it literally means 'to have the body'
-when an individual is detained without legal justification or he is missing then the writ of Habeas Corpus is issued by the court ordering that the person
be produced before the court so that court can set him free 
-this writ can be filed before the court by an individual or organisation and not necessarily by the agrieved himself and thus the principle of 'Locus Standi'
may not apply in the case, principle of Locus Standi is a right of a person to go to the court to get his rights implemented, since in this case the person is 
behind the bars or missing he himself cannot approach the court.
Locus Standi - a person has to take his own stand before the court if he is agrieved

2. Mandamus 
-it literally means 'Command'
-this writ is issued in the nature of command by Judiciary against a public authority or a person holding a public office
-the purpose of Mandamus is to command/order a public authority or official to do or not-to-do certain acts which are in the nature of public duty 
-Mandamus can be issued to implement a public or a legal right but not a private right, it cannot be issued to President/Governor and can also not be used
against a public authority in the case when the authority is making the use its discretionary powers

3. Prohibition
-it is a writ issued only against a Judicial or a Quasi-Judicial body to ensure that the body remains within the limits of its jurisdiction if such a body takes
up a case by going beyong its jurisdiction that the writ of Prohibition is issued which prohibits them from proceeding with the case 

4. Certiorari
-it is similar to Prohibition except that it is issued to quash/kill a judgement/direction/order issued by a Judicial or Quasi-Judicial body by going beyond
its jurisdiction

5. Quo Warranto
-it literally means 'What is your Authority?'
-the purpose of this writ is to ensure that a person holding public office is qualified enough or competent enough to hold that office

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 32 vs Article 226

Article 32
-Article 32 is itself a fundamental right i.e. approaching SC for restoration of FRs is itself a FR
-SC can issue writs only for the enforcement of FRs but not any other legal rights
-Constitution places a duty on SC to enforce a FR if found violated, thus SC has to implement FRs if found violated
-the writ jurisdiction of SC extends over whole of India 

Article 226
-approaching HC under Article 226 is not a FR
-HC can issue writs not only for the emforcement of FRs but also for other legal rights
-there is no such Constitutional boundation on HC's to implement FRs if found violated, therefore HC's may or may not implement these rights and may suggest
some other remedy in place of implementing these rights
-writ jurisdiction of HC is limited by territorial boundaries

Conclusion - thus we can see that the writ jurisdiction of HCs is a bit more than SC as under Article 226 HCs can issue writs not only for restoration of FRs
but also other legal rights, whereas under Article 32, SC has the power to issue writs only for restoration of FRs

Relationship between Fundamental Rights & DPSP

-Article 37 says that Directive Principles are not enforceable in a court of law, nevertheless they are fundamental in the governance of the country
-it is the duty of the State to incorporate the DPSPs in policies formulated and law enacted 
-SC in State of Madras vs Champakam Durairajan Case 1951 held that the law made to enforce the Directive Principles cannot overwrite Fundamental Rights 
and they must confirm and run subsidiary to FRs
-in case of any conflict between FRs and DPSPs, FRs will prevail over DPSP

-however realising the importance of DPSPs in order to establish a welfare State, SC in Re-Kerala Education Bill Case 1957 adopted the theory of Harmonious 
Construction and held that though DPSP cannot overwrite FRs, nevertheless in determining the scope and limits of FRs, courts cannot completely ignore the DPSPs
and should interpret the case in such a way to give effect to both FRs and DPSP as much as possible because there is no inherent conflict between DPSP and FRs
so it is the responsibility of the court to interpret the Constitution in such a way so as to implement the DPSPs along with ensuring non-violation of FRs 
however if only 1 interpretation is possible then courts have no choice but to implement the FRs in preference to DPSPs

-therefore on the basis of above interpretation, SC held Bank Nationalisation Act 1969 and Privy Purses Abolition Act 1971 which were enacted by Parliament to 
give effect to Article 39(b) and 39(c) to be unconstitutional and void on the ground that these laws were violating FRs under Article 14, 19 and 31

-however Parliament held that such an interpretation given by SC will block Social legislations in the larger interest of Society and to find a way out Parliament
enacted 25th Amendment Act 1971 which introduced Article 31C which reads that if State enacts a law to give effect to 2 Directives under Article 39(b) and 39(c)
and this law violates the FR under Article 14, 19 and 31 then the law cannot be held unconstitutional merely on this ground and such a law cannot be questioned 
in the court of law

-in Keshavananda Bharati vs State of Kerala Case 1973, the introduction of Article 31C through 25th Amendment Act was challenged but the court gave the judgement
in the favour of Parliament by declaring 25th Amendment Act to be valid, however the struck down the provision which prevented the Judicial Review of such law

-after this through 42nd Amendment Act 1976, Parliament again amended Article 31C which provided that if State enacts a law to give effect to all or any DPSPs
and in that process the law violates the FRs under Article 14, 19 or 31 then the law shall not be held unconstitutional and void merely on this ground

-subsequently through 44th Amendment Act 1978, Parliament removed Article 19(1)(f) and Article 31 from the list of FRs

-now SC in Minerva Mills Case 1980 struck down the widening of Article 31 through 42nd Amendment Act 1976 by saying that this was disturbing the delicate balance 
between DPSPs and FRs and this balance between Part III and Part IV is a part of Basic Structure of IC, court also clarified that the power of Judicial Review
was the part of Basic Structure of the IC thus the present position is that under Article 31C only 2 Directives under Article 39(b) and 39(c) can prevail over
2 FRs under Article 14 and 19

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Directives to State in IC outside Part IV of the IC
-though Part IV of the IC formally deals with DPSP but there are some Directives which are enumerated/mentioned in other parts of the IC also, these Directives 
are also non-justiciable by nature 

Article 335 
-it directs that the claims of SCs/STs shall be taken into consideration consistently along with maintenance of efficiency of administration while making appointments
to the services of the govt.

Article 350A
-it directs the State and the local authorities within the State to provide adequate facilities for instruction in mother tongue till primary stage to the children
of linguistic minorities 

Article 351
-it directs the govt. to promote the spread of Hindi so that it may serve as a medium of expression of all the elements of composite culture of India

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Uniform Civil Code 
-it means all the sections of society irrespective of Religion shall be treated equally according to a National Civil Code which shall apply uniformly to all 
and will be developed in a Scientific way as per modern values, Civil Code covers areas like Marriage, Divorce, Maintenance, Inheritance, Adoption etc.
it will enhance the status of women and prevent her exploitation, issues like Marriage, Succession and similar matters are secular in nature and thus State
can regulate them equally for all, they are not religious matters and thus UCC is not a violation of Article 25 and 26, many aspects of civil code are already 
uniformly codified under Civil Procedures Code, Evidence Act, Transfer of Property Act etc which apply equally to all irrespective of religion and the goal of 
UCC is to bring uniformity in the remaining areas which are personal in nature 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FRs vs DPSPs

-FRs are enforceable in the court of law 
-DPSPs are non-enforceable in the court of law

-FRs are negative obligation of the State i.e. State is not to violate FRs
-DPSPs are positive affirmation of the State i.e. State has a duty to realise the provisions of Part IV

-FRs represent something Static where the basic rights have been conferred on the individual and the aim is only to conserve those rights 
-DPSPs represent something Dynamic where the State has to keep on taking the actions in order to extend these rights to the people 

-FRs provide for Political Democracy 
-DPSPs seek to establish Social and Economic Democracy

-FRs are given in strict legal language
-DPSPs are given in genereal term

-FRs promote welfare of individual and are thus personal and individualistic 
-DPSPs promote the welfare of community and hence are societarian and socialistic

-courts are bound to declare a law unconstitutional and void if the law violates the provisions of FRs
-courts cannot declare a law unconstitutional only on the ground that the law is violative of provisions of DPSPs

-FRs dont need laws to implement them, they are in themselves law
-DPSPs require laws to implement them, they have no value by themselves

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Importance of DPSP

-it is the Directive Principles which if implemented well have a potential to establish a Welfaric State
-Dr BR Ambedkar pointed out that a govt. which is responsible to people shall have to implement these principles otherwise it will be answerable to people 
in the next election thus these principles may not be enforceable in the court of law but they are certainly enforceable in the court of people 
-these principles may not enjoy legal sanctions/punishment but they enjoy political sanctions 
-these principles act as a light house constantly reminding the govt. of the day about their responsibilities of taking the country towards Welfarism
-these principles act as a testing ground to measure the performance of the govt.
-these principles bring uniformity in the overall political approach of Indian State no matter which political party is in power
-Directive Principles have not been given legal enforceability not because they are inferior to any other part of the IC but because these principles require
time and material resources at the disposal of the State which cannot be achieved in a fixed time frame

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part V - The Union [Article 52 - 151]

Chapter I - The Executive

The President of India [Article 52 - 62]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 52 - The President of India
-There shall be a President of India

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 53
-it confers the Executive Powers of the Union in the President of India and he shall discharge these powers either directly or through officers sub-ordinate to him
according the Constitution
-President is the Executive Head of the Union as well as the 'Highest Constitutional Functionary'
-all decisions of the Union Executive are taken in the name of President because of Article 53
-he is regarded as the first citizen of India and the Supreme Commander of Armed Forces
-the executive powers vested/given in the President are to be excercised by him on the advice of Council of Ministers according to Article 74 of the IC
-Article 74 in original form read about a COM headed by Prime Minister to aid and advice the President but it did not explicitly state that President was bound
by the advice
-42nd Amendment Act 1976 amended Article 74 and in amended form it made the President bound by the advice of COM
-44th Amendment Act 1978 again amended Article 74 and added a provision that President may ask the COM to re-consider the advice but the President shall act
in accordance with the advice given to him after such re-consideration
-though President is not a member of either house of the Parliament but he is very much a part of Parliament evident from the fact that without his assent
the bill does not become an act
-only President summons/calls the sessions of the Parliament and he prorogues/calls of the houses of the Parliament
-he has a power to dissolve Lok Sabha

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 58 - Qualifications for Election as President
-the candidate must be citizen of India
-age not less than 35 years 
-he must be qualified to be elected to Lok Sabha
-he should not be holding any office of Profit under the State
-however for the purpose of the office of President, the President, Vice President, Governor, Minister is not considered as holding office of Profit
-if the President elect is MP or MLA or MLC, he is deemed to have vacated his seat in the legislature before entering the office of the President

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 54 - Election of President 
-under Article 54, President of India is elected indirectly through an electoral college (group of voters) consisting of elected members of both the houses of the
Parliament and the elected members of the State Legislative Assemblies
-after 70th Amendment Act 1992, the expression 'States started to include the Union Territories of Delhi and Pondicherry as well'

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 55 - Manner of Election of President
-the States on one hand and Parliament on another are equally represented in the electoral college which means that President represents the Nation and also the 
State at federal(National) level
-President of India is elected through a system called 'Proportional Representation through Single Transferable Vote System' and the voting shall be held through
Secret Ballot  

Proportional Representational System
-it means that States are represented in the electoral college of the President in accordance with the population of the State as per 1971 census 

Formula

Vote value of 1 Elected MLA of specific State =     Total Population of that State      X 1
						            --------------------------------------- -----
						            Total no. of Elected MLAs in that State  1000

			 Vote value of 1 Elected MP = Total vote value of all elected MLAs
							      ------------------------------------
				         			     Total no. of elected MPs

		    Vote value of all elected MPs = Vote value of all elected MLAs

Note
-as the vote value is directly proportional to the population of the State, it gives an edge to more populous States over less populous ones
-Southern States that have worked to control their population demanded parity of vote value
-considering that Parliament made a provision through 84th Amendment Act 2001 stating that
-Population of 1971 will be taken into account because at this time all the State were growing uniformly in terms of Population and this will remain so till 2026
-the vote value of MP in electoral college of President is same all across whether he is from UP, Bihar, Kerala or Sikkim, Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha
-but the vote value of MLA's in electoral college of President differ from State-to-State because that depends upon the population of the State
-MLC are not involved in the election of President as only 6 States have MLCs, also MLA are directly elected by people while MLC may not be directly elected by people

Single Transferable Vote System

-under this system the elector has a right to indicate more than one preference of the candidate and he can indicate as many preferences as there are candidates 
in the contest
-in the first round of counting only the first preference votes are considered and if a candidate obtains more than 50% of the valid votes he will win 
if not then the candidate with least no. of first preference votes is eliminated and the second preferences of his votes are distributed among the rest of the 
candidates and again a majority of 50% is seen
-this process continues till a candidate wins with majority

Note
-Whip is a binding on the members of a political party to follow the party's direction
-in the election of President, Whip is not issued to the voters as whom to vote for
-the MLAs of a suspended assembly vote during the elections of the President
-however if a particular Legislative Assembly has been dissolved then that State will no participate in the election of President

Note
-The Secretary General Lok Sabha and The Secretary General Rajya Sabha act as ex-officio Returning Officer of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Election
and they take turns to preside over the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections
-The Nomination Paper of the Presidential candidate shall be proposed by not less than 50 electors/voters(MP/MLAs) and it shall be seconded by another not less
than 50 electors
-Candidate has to pay a security deposit of Rs. 15000 
-the disputes relating to the Presidential election shall be heard by SC whose decision is final and binding, if in case the election of President is declared void
on any ground then the decisions taken in his name prior to that shall not become invalid on this ground

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 61 - Procedure for Impeachment of the President

-under Article 61, President of India is impeached by Parliament on the grounds of violation of IC
-however IC didn't describe what acts of the President amount to violation of IC
-it is thus a political determination to be made by Parliament
-the motion seeking the impeachment of the President shall be introduced in form of a resolution in either house of the Parliament
-in order to be introduced, the resolution must be supported by not less than 1/4th of the total membership of the house 
-the resolution can be taken up in the house for passage only after the expiry of 14 days notice
-the motion is passed in the house by a majority of not less than 2/3rd  of the total membership of the house
-once it is passed in the house, it is transmitted to the other house which acts as the investigating house 
-the second house investigates the charges against the President or may cause the charges to be investigated 
-President has a right to defend himself or through an attorney/lawyer of his choice before the second house
-the functions performed by the second house are quasi-judicidal in nature 
-after investigation if the second house also passes the motion by a majority of not less than 2/3rd of the total membership of the house, then the 
President stands impeached
-there can be judicial review of Presidential Impeachment
-the decisions taken by the President or in his name will not become invalid after the impeachment only due to the act of impeachment
-Impeachment of the President is a legislative action whereas removal of other officers like SC/HC Judges, CAG, Governor etc is an executive action because
it is being done by the Executive Head of India
