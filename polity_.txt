Union
-Parliament is the law making body of the Union
-it is bicameral, has two houses Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
-ideally, tenure of LS is 5 years, tenure of RS is infinite as it is a permanent body
-ideally, tenure of LS MPs is 5 years, tenure of RS MPs is 6 years
-in every 5 years, fresh elections are called to fill the LS
-in every 2 years, 1/3rd of the RS MPs retire, and new MPs are brought in
-at any point of time, atleast 2/3rd of the RS is always filled
-party that proves majority in LS forms the govt. their leader is made the P.M.
-the P.M. chosen has to be the member of the Parliament, if he is not so, he has to become a member within 6 months
-P.M. picks his council of ministers from LS/RS, collectively they are called Executives, or Govt. in layman's term
-Executives are those who implement laws made by the Legislative
-P.M. along with his council of ministers and a chain of officers (Bureaucracy) forms the Executives
-P.M. along with his council of minsiters are Political Executives, while chain of officers are Permanent Excecutives
-ministers chosen has to be a member of the Parliament, if not they have to be one withing next 6 months
-not every MP is a minister, but every minister is an MP
-P.M. can be from any of the house LS/RS, Manmohan Singh was from RS, Modi is from LK
-LK only containes elected members, RS has both elected, nominated members
-President nominates 12 members in the RS, who has exceptional knowledge in the field of Art/Literature/Science/Social Services
-Sachin Tendulkar, Mary Kom were exceptions that were nominated in RS from the field of Sports by the Supreme Court
-Constitutionally, Sports is not mentioned as the field to nominate someone
-The amendment act of 104 removed the 2 seats of Anglo-Indians that were nominated in the LS

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
State
-Similar to Parliament, we have State Legislative Assembly in the states
-6 states: UP, Bihar, Maharashtra, Karnataka, A.P., Telangana have 2 houses in the law making
-rest all states only have 1 house of law making
-the State Legislative Assembly and the State Legislative Council
-the members of the SLA are only elected just like LS, called MLA
-the members of the SLC are elected, nominated just like RS, called MLC
-Governor nominates some MLCs from the field of Art/Literature/Science/Social Science/Co-operative movements
-party that proves majority in the SLA forms the govt. 
-C.M. choses his council of minister in a similar way

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Constitution
-many countries have written constitution, while many have unwritten constitution
-India, Srilanka, U.S. have written one, while U.K. NZ, etc have unwritten one 
-this implies that countries like ours have laws written/codified in a book which we can call constitution
-while other countries doesn't have such a book
-they have various laws but not a single book called Constitution
-Written Constitution is one whose articles and provisions are written/codified into a single legal document/book
-in WC, distinct is made btw the provisions of Constitution and other laws
-in WC, it is the Constitution which is supreme and all other organs(Parliament, Executive, Judiciary) of the state are suppose to follow it
-in WC, Judiciary generally enjoys wider powers where it can declare an enactment/law of Parliament or action of Executive to be unconstitutional and thus nullified

-WC is an enacted Constitution i.e. it was made by a special body at a specific point of time
-WC may be rigid/flexible or a combination of both, in India, some parts can be changed easily, some with difficulty
-countris with WC may be federal/unitary
-Unwritten Constitution is one whose provisions are not codified/compiled into a single legal document/book
-in UC, each and every enactment of the Parliament becomes part of their Constitution
-i.e. there is no distinction btw Constitutional and other laws
-in UC, Parliament is supreme because every enactment/law of the Parliament becomes their Constitution
-in UC, Judiciary cannot declare an enactment of Parliament as unconstitutional
-UC gives rise to unitary setup only
-UC is always flexible because all it takes to change the Constitution is to bring a new law by Parliament
-UC is an evolved one as it is an outcoming/efforts of many bodies over a period of time
-before the Constitution was written, it was decided primarily what should be the theme/objective/purpose of our IC
-Ojective Resolution was the document written by J.L. Nehru that served that basis
-it was moved before the Constituent Assembly where it was voted and accepted upon
-this document serverd as the basis on which the IC was written
-Preamble is the document that forms the summary of the IC
-Chronologically, the order was: Objective Resolution -> IC -> Preamble
-In India, laws that are written in the IC are called Constitutinal laws such as fundamental duties etc
-while laws not a part of the IC called Ordinary laws are inferior to these Constitutional laws, these are MNREGA, CAA etc
-it implies that these laws support the Constitutional ones
-CL are superior to OL because changing them is difficult and they act as a reference
-in U.K., as there's no constitution, every law is equal and holds equal value

Indian Constitution
-IC is divided into parts, which contains articles
-at enactment, it had 22 parts, 395 articles, 8 schedules
-at present, it has 25 parts, 470 articles, 12 schedules
-4 parts[IVA, IXA, IXB, XIVA] were added, 1 part[VII] was repealed
-IVA: Fundamental Duties - Article 51A
-IXA: Municipalities
-IXB: Co-operative societies 
-XIVA: Tribunals - Articles 323A to 323B
-total 104 amendments are made till date
-lastly added IXB by the 97th Amendment

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Constitutionalism
-Constitutionalism means as system with a limited govt. i.e. a governance setup whose powers are not arbitrary or unrestricted i.e. 
it is a system having limited govt. 
-example of max. absence of Constitutionalism are: Hitler from Germany, Saddam Hussain from Iraq, Kim Jong-un from N. Korea, Gaddafi from Libya
-Hitler executed Jews whenever he wanted, Kim executes anybody he feels so
-Unlimited govt. is one which concentrates maximum power of administration in few hands which leads to corruption, violation of human rights
and encroachment/violation on the liberty of common man
-the provisions which ensure Constitutionalism are
-a democratically formed Constitution
-separation of powers(SOP)
-checks and balances
-independent Judiciary
-power of Judicial review
-rule of law, fundamental rights and various tools of transparency like RTI, e-governace etc
-Constitutionalism not only places limits on the powers of administration but it also requires that
people of the society also fulfil their duties and they do not become disrespectful to the laws in the country
-In India, political culture needs to improve with time so that the members of the govt. maintains self discipline and try not to break the law
-even civil society in India is divided on the grounds of religion, race, caste, language etc
-thus they do not put effective check on the govt. which weakens the idea of Constitutionalism

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parliamentry v/s Presidential system of govt.
--Parliamentary
-executive is a part of legislature
-here ministers are from Parliament only, or if not, they must become MP within a fixed time which in case of India is 6 months
-the council of ministers is represented by PM and this body the true executive making all the most important decisions of administration
-the President is the head of the state not having much real executive powers (decision making powers) and he is a nominal (name sake) head of the state 
-the COM is responsible to the LS in case of India
-it puts greater stress on the idea of responsible executive even if it is less stable 
--Presidential
-executive and legislature are two clearly 2 separate bodies
-here ministers are not part of legislature and the President choses his team of ministers from amongst the citizens at large
-President is the real head executive of the state who is also the head of the govt. having a ministerial cell (COM) to assist/guide him
-President and his ministerial cell is not much responsible to the legislature
-it puts greater stress on the idea of a stable executive even if it is less accountable to the legislature

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Separation of Power
-the French philosopher Montesquieu gave the idea of SOP in which 3 organs of the state i.e. legislature, executive and judiciary
shall be separated into water type compartments with an objective of preventing the state from becoming totalitarian (absolutely powerful)
-thus individual liberty can be safeguarded 
-USA was the first nation to implement this idea
-India accepted the idea of SOP in a modified form called the principle of 'Checks and Balances'
where all the 3 organs of the state i.e. legislature, executive and judiciary exercise some form of control over each other
and thus all the three organs maintain a balance among each other and impose responsibility on each other
-India follows Parliamentary system of govt. where executive is a part of legislature and thus pure SOP is not possible
-SC in 1996 declared that the theory of SOP and the basic structure of the Constitution is an integral part of IC
and thus both of them form the elements of basic structure of the IC

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preamble
-Preamble is regarded as the introduction or prelude (beginning) to the Constitution
-it carries the essence/summary of the whole Constitution
-it also contains the basic values which are found in the Constitution
-according to D.D.Basu, it contains the philosophy or the theme of the Constitution
-it contains the key to unravel the minds of Constitution makers and it tells us the intentions 
they had in the mind regarding various provisions of the Constitution
-it is in the form of a declaration but it does not confer any substantive powers on the organs of the govt.
or citizens nor it limits those powers
-it cannot overwrite specific provisions of the Constitution i.e. Preamble is subordinate to Constitution 
if there's a clash btw an article of the Constitution and the Preamble then former shall prevail over the Preamble
-as per SC if there is an ambiguity surrounding an article of the Constitution then that interpretation of the article
may be used by the courts which tallies/matches with the Preamble
-Preamble has an enacting clause where it declares that the Constitution of India was enacted and adopted on 26 Nov. 1949
-Preamble of IC declares that the source of all the powers of the Constitution is the people of India themselves 
i.e. Constitution arises from people only which means that Preamble indicates that people of India are the ultimate
sovereign, however in Keher Singh vs Union of India case 1989, the statement was challenged that Constitution derives 
its powers from people directly, but the court said that this statement that Constitution derives its powers from people 
directly is a legal fiction but it is a conclusive assumption which cannot be tested or challenged in any 
court of law and should be accepted as such 
-Preamble contains the ideals and the aspirations of people of India
-Ideals are the means to achieve the aspirations
-5 ideals mentioned are Sovereignity, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic
-4 aspirations are Liberty, Justice, Equality and Fraternity
-Preamble may help the judiciary in giving the legal interpretation of the Constitutional provisions
Is Preamble part of the Constitution
-the traditional view was that Preamble was not a part of the Constitution because even it is removed from the Constitution, 
the Constitution would continue to function further unlike the Constitution, Preamble does not confer or limit the powers of the organs of the state
and thus Preamble has a very limited role to play in the Constitution. SC in Berubari case 1960 held that Preamble was not a part of the Constitution
but the modern view is that Preamble is considered to be part of the Constitution because only if Preamble is a part of Constitution 
then only it can be amended under Article 368 to maintain a pace with the modern day Constitution and Parliamentary Philosophy, 
therefore SC over wrote its earlier decision in Kesavananda Bharati vs State of Kerala case 1973 that Preamble is a part of Constitution

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sovereignity
-Sovereignity means that the country's govt is totally independent and it does not acknowledge any arbitrary power as supreme with 
regard to the governance of the country either within its boundary or internationally
-in the era of Liberalisation, Privatisation, Globalisation (LPG) when every country is a part of number of International Agreements, treaties
and agencies it is said that countries have lost their freedom to take independent decisions which is a question mark on their soverignity
and India is not an exception, however this argument may not be completely true particularly for India since even in the globalised world
India is taking decisions keeping in mind the highest interest of people of India and its constitutional values and India does not agree to
-India does not give in to any kind of arbitrary pressure, moreover in the National Interest if India has to put its foot down India does so 
whether it was Dokhlam stand off or resisting the American pressure with regard to S400 missiles so largely the global factors have not 
eroded the Sovereinity of India

Secularism
-Secularism means that the state does not acknowledge its closeness with any particular religion i.e. state shall not recognise any particular
religion as the official religion of the country.
-in Indian context, it means state is neither religious nor irreligious/anti-religious rather India is non-religious in character
-in India, all the religion that have made India their home have the right to co-exist in the soil of India
-most of the western countries like France or Germany also maintain a secular orientation since these countries also do not show 
affiliation to any specific religion however unlike India where state promotes all the religions. In the west, state maintains a distance 
from church/religion which means every religion for example- in west, if govt. takes decision, the decisions are taken for their objective
value, however when in India, decisions are taken, the decisions do not ignore the religious sentiments or religious understanding of any religion
-India actively promotes all the religion, whereas in west, state does not invest to promote in religion which includes all the religion
if analysed deeply then the approach of secularism taken up by India is better than the secular approach of the west as it brings more security
and consolation among the people of all the religions as they feel that state is there to protect their religious practices and religious sentiments

Socialism
-Socialism in general means that benefit of the societal resources should reach every member of the society 
and nobody should be left out from enjoying the benefits of the resources. 
-Also concentration of wealth in few hands should be prevented unlike USSR which tried to achieve socialistic goals 
through the model called Marxist Socialism involving complete Nationalisation
-in India we took up the model of Democratic Socialism or Fabian Socialism in which socialistic goals are to be achieved but through Democratic means 
-in which private ownership and private businesses are also allowed besides govt. ownership and govt. enterprises (PSU) 
-it is a case of mixed economy supported by policies like Progressive Taxation, Land Ceiling Act, and govt. run welfare schemes etc

Democracy
-Democracy is a system where people decide regarding the decisions of the govt.
-in this context every member of the society should be allowed to express and be heard while making decisions of governance
so in a way it is governance by the people
-Democracy can be direct where people directly tell about their views regarding particular questions of governance however its not quiet practical 
to implement direct democracy in India because of huge population and a big size of the population being illiterate so we follow indirect democracy 
or representative democracy where people choose their representatives and these representatives take the decisions of governance on the behalf of people
thus incorporating the views and the aspirations of every member of society in the decision making process though indirectly
-Democracy is very crutial for the overall development of the country however certain threats or weaknesses particularly in Indian Democracy
-for example, people choosing wrong representatives to become their voice in the governance system is a big threat however this often happen
-this happens because criminal elements or non serious candidates becoming the voice of people which happens because many of them buy votes
and some are brought to power by the misuse of muscle power
-people voting for parochial factors like religion, race, caste, language, region can also bring wrong representatives to power which can 
weaken democracy
-people not excercising right to vote also weakens democracy
-representatives not communicating with the group they represent also weakens democracy
-however this vacuum can be filled through unbiased media
-however considered the 4th pillar of democracy if becomes biased and corrupt then this can destabilize democracy and encourage people
to take wrong decisions in future also 
-misuse of various laws to suppress political dessent is also a threat to democracy
-political defections for personal benefit will also weaken democracy 
-illiteracy and poverty are also two weaknesses or threat to democracy
--however the ray of hope lies in 
-electoral reforms particularly to fight criminalisation of politics
-making the anti-defection law effective
-fighting fake news
-independent and strong judiciary is a must for democracy
-people voting more in number and voting responsibly will strengthen democracy
-tools of accoutability like RTI and e-governance will also strengthen democracy

Republic
-Republic is a system where people are supreme and even the head of the state is elected by people and there is no hereditary ruler in the country

Aspirations of Preamble
--Justice
-Preamble talks about comprehensive justice i.e. Political, Social and Economic Justice achieved through various provisions of the Constitution like
-Political Justice achieved through right to vote and right to contest in the election under Article 326
-Social Justice achieved through fundamentals rights under Article 14, 15, 17, 18 etc
-Economic Justice achieved through various fundamental rights like right to vocation or various directive principles
--Liberty
-Liberty is the absence of arbitrary powers exercised by an individual or an institution against other individuals or group thereby allowing
the individual or the group an opportunity to grow or achieve their full potential  
--Equality
-Preamble talks about equality of opportunity and equality of status
--Fraternity
-Fraternity is a sense of brotherhood that prevails among all the people of India which is very essential to promote the unity and integrity of India
and save the dignity of individual

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 2
Citizenship
-A Citizen is an individual who enjoys the full membership of the country and he enjoys all the rights available in the country
-there are some rights in India which are reseverd for Indian citizens only for example- the right under Article 15, 16, 19, 29, 30, 326 etc
-the IC does not lay down permanent or detailed provisions regarding the citizenship in India 
-Part 2 of the IC simply describes the classes of persons who would deamed to be the citizen of India at the commencement of the Constitution
and has the detailing of the laws regarding citizenship onto Parliament
-Article 11 of the IC confers the powers onto the Parliament to make laws on Citizenship and using this power Parliament enacted Indian Citizenship Act 1955
which provides for the acquisition and termination of Indian Citizenship
-the IC provides only for single citizenship and prohibits dual 
-Indian Citizenship Act 1955 is based on 2 legal principles
--1st is Jus Soli i.e. law of soil 
--2nd is Jus Sanguine i.e. law of blood

Indian Citizenship Act 1955 as amended from time to time provides for 5 ways through which 1 can acquire the Indian Citizenship
1. Citizenship by birth
-a person born in India >= 26 Jan 1950 and < 1 July 1987 is a citizen of India by birth irrespective of the Nationality of his parents
-a person born in India >= 1 July 1987 and < 3 Dec 2004 is a citizen of India by birth if either of his parents is a citizen of India at the time of his birth
-a person born in India >= 3 Dec 2004 is a citizen of India by birth if both the parents are citizen of India at the time of birth or if only 1 parent is 
India citizen the other must not be illegal migrant at the time of birth
--illegal migrant is a foreigner who entered India without a valid passport or proper documentation 

2. Citizenship by descent
-a person born outside India >= 26 Jan 1950 and < 10 Dec 1992 is a citizen of India by descent if his father was citizen of India at the time of his birth
-a person born outside India >= 10 Dec 1992 and < 3 Dec 2004 is a citizen of India by descent if either of his parents was citizen of India at the time of his birth
-a person born outside India >= 3 Dec 2004 is a citizen of India by descent if either of his parents was citizen of India at the time of his birth, and parents
give an undertaking that the minor does not hold the passport of any other country and his birth must be registered at an Indian Counulate withing 1 year of birth

3. Incorporation of territory
-when a new territory is acquired by India then the individuals living there can have an option of adopting Indian Citizenship

--all the above three categories of citizens are referred as Natural Born Citizens

4. Citizenship through Registration
-Indian citizenship through Registration can be acquired by an eligible applicant for example- 
--a citizen of a commonwealth country
--a foreigner who married Indian citizen
--minor child of Indian parents etc
-who is ordinarily residing in India for 7 years before making the application
-of these 7 years, 1 year before he applies for the citizenship he must be living in India continuosly for 1 year
and 8 years previous to that, his total stay in India must be minimum 6 years
-for OCI, the period of stay in India is 1 year	

5. Citizenship through Naturalisation
-it can be acquired by foreigners who are ordinarily residing in India for 12 years
-of these 12 years, he must be living in India continuously for 1 year before making the application and his stay in India
14 years previous to this 1 year comes out to be of minimum 11 years

Loss of Indian Citizenship

1. Renunciation 
-it is a volunatary act on the part of Indian Citizen who wants to surrender his Indian Citizenship 
-Govt. of India may or may not accept the application of renunciation

2. Termination
-it is an act of law when an Indian Citizen obtains the citizenship of a foreign country but he does not surrender his Indian Citizenship
-then the terminates his Indian Citizenship
-it is not a punishment

3. Deprivation
-if a person obtains the Indian Citizenship through fraud, misrepresentation of facts, then he can be derprived of his Citizenship
-if a person is residing out of India for 7 years or more without a proper reason or valid permission or he shows disloyalty to the IC 
or unlawfully trades or communicates with an enemy country during war then he can be deprived of his Indian Citizenship
-it is a punishment

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Federal vs Unitary
-In a federal system, 2 forms of govt. co-exist and none is inferior to other as both derive their powers from Constitution itself
-in a federal system, Constitution has to be written and it should divide the powers between Center and States and this division of powers 
btw Center and States is binding upon both the Center as well as the States i.e. Constitution is supreme, also Federal Constitution are difficult
to amend i.e. they are rigid by nature, this way the division of power btw Center and the States can be protected from any undue/unrequired change
either by Center alone or by State alone rather if Constitution needs to be amended it must be amended with the mutual concent of both Center and States
-in federal system to maintain the division of power btw Center and State and resolve the disputes over the division power btw them there must be an 
independent arbitrator who must also have the power to interpret the Constitution, for ex - in India, Supreme Court is one such power
-US, Australia, Canada

-In Unitary system, there exists 1 supreme govt. i.e. at Center though State governments are there but they are only the administrative arms of Center
working as per directions of Center
-in Unitary system, Constitution may be written or unwritten
-Unitarty system will have a flexible Constitution which can be changed by Parliament alone 
-in Unitary system, Judiciary may not be that powerful, particularly with respect to its jurisdiction on the areas related to distribution of powers
btw Center and States
-France, Britain

Nature of Indian Federal Constitution
-experts believe that IC is federal, though some believe it is not truly federal rather it is quasi-federal or a federation with bias towards Unitarism
-howerver SC said that whatever is the degree of federalism in IC, federalism is the part of basic structure of the IC
-due to the following features, we can conclude that IC is a federal Constitution or atleast near to it
1. Written Constitution
-a federal Constitution necessarily is a written Constitution and since India has a written Constitution, it supports the case of India being federal
2. Division/Distribution of Power
-in a federal system, there are 2 forms of govt. i.e. Center and States, and none is sub-ordinate to other as both derives their powers from the Constitution
and both are supreme in their respective area of activity and act like coordinating bodies
3. Supremacy of Constitution 
-in a federal context, Constitution is binding upon Center and the State governments and both have to respect it and perform only those functions which are 
allowed under the Constitution 
4. Rigidity of Constitution
-federal Constitution is rigid atleast in some areas which deal with distribution of powers btw Center and States
-IC is a mix of being rigid and flexible but it is rigid i.e. difficult to amend particularly on those parts which affect the distribution of powers btw
Center and the States, for ex- under Article 368 the procedure to amend the Constitution in the following 5 areas is quiet difficult i.e. Constitution is rigid
in these 5 areas because these amendments are to be first passed by Parliament that too by a majority of not less than 2/3rd of the members present and voting
and the majority of total membership of the house after which atleast 50% of the State Legislative Bodies need to approve the amendment before it is sent to 
the President for his assent, other than these 5 areas, other amendments in the Constitution are simply approved by the Parliament by special majority and 
States are not involved
5. Authority of Courts
-to resolve the disputes that may arise btw Center and the States over distribution of Powers, there must be an authority independent of both and that authority 
should also have the power to interpret the Constitution, such an authority in India is a SC of India indicating that India is federal 

Distinctive nature of Indian Federal System (here we are proving that India is a Unitary)

1. Single Citizenship, Single Constitution, Single Judiciary
-US and Australia are seen as benchmark of a federal system, for ex- US has got a system in which there is a Constitution dealing with the federal administration
and also States have their own Constitution, US has a dual Judicial system in which States have their own SC and their is a SC of US which does not have 
administrative control over the States Judiciary, US system allows dual citizenship in which an individual is not only the citizen of the country but also 
he belongs to a state as a citizen, however IC possesses certain essential features of a federal system yet it differs much from the typical federal model 
followed in typical federal countries, for ex- in India, States do not have their respective Constitution, their is no dual citizenship, there is a single
Judicial system across India

2. Under Article 3 of the IC, Parliament can change the name, area, or boundary of any State with or even without the consent of the state i.e. in India, States
do not enjoy a permanent independent identity which is a deviation from understanding about federal systems of the world

3. during normal situations in India, Center and States work according to their Constitutionally guaranteed powers i.e. distribution of power exist btw Center
and States, however during emergency this distribution of power shifts in the favour of Center making India appear Unitary, this is seen as a big flaw/weakness
in Indian federal system as it has no fixed character, however it is not so in reality having flexibility in our federal design is the requirement of
realities of India, for ex- India has to be federal specifically because of the reasons of cultural and geographical diversities as well as political 
and historical reasons required India to allow the States to have autonomy/powers in some areas, however India also has to have a Unitary touch in its 
federal polity particularly during the times of crisis or emergency because of the fact that in many states there exists a tendency to break away which is
further fueled by the presence of hostile neighbours, Center also has to be more dominant for the reason Center can bring oneness across all the states of 
India inspite of huge cultural diversities and conflict for resources among the states keeping India united

4. Schedule 7 of the IC distributes the legislative powers btw Center and the States making India appear federal however this distribution is largely in the favour 
of Center for the following reasons 
a. the union list not only has more subjects but they are more critical also by nature and these subjects allow Center to raise more revenue 
b. the law made by Center has jurisdiction across India whereas the law made by States on the subjects of State list apply locally 
c. even on concurrent list the claim of Center is prior and superior 
d. the subjects of State list are not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the States i.e. even Center can very well interfere in these areas, for ex under
the following 5 extra-ordinary conditions Parliament can legislate/make laws over the subjects of State list 
i. under Article 249 if RS passes a resolution by a majority of not less than 2/3rd of the members present and voting that it is urgently in National Interest
for the Parliament to legislate over specified subjects of the State list then Parliament assumes the legislative jurisdiction over those specified subjects 
of the State list. the valididy of such a law can be min 0.5 year and max 1.5 years [keyword: Rajya Sabha, National Interest] 
ii. under Article 250 during National Emergency, Parliament assumes concurrent legislative jurisdiction over the subjects under State's list
this law if made by Parliament shall expire after 6 months from the date emergency comes to an end
iii. under Article 252 if 2 or more than 2 State Legislatures pass a resolution authorizing the Parliament to legislate over specified subjects of the State list
then Parliament assumes the jurisdiction over those subjects for those States and the law shall remain valid till the time it is repelled by the Parliament 
iv. under Article 253, Parliament can pass a law on a subject of State list with or without the consent of the State for implementation of International Treaties 
v. under Article 356, when President's rule is imposed in a State and the State Assembly is suspended/dissolved then Parliament gets exclusive legislative 
jurisdiction with respect to the subjects of the State list for the concerned State

5. under Article 248, the residuary power of legislation belongs to Parliament 

6. under Article 155, Governor of a State is appointed by the President and he holds during the pleasure of President which means that Governor who is the 
head of the State comes under the influence of the Center and through the office of Governor, Center can influence the State

7. Comptroller and Auditor General of India carries the audit of accounts for both the Union and the State Govts, he is appointed by the President and removed
by him with the approval of Parliament. Thus many a times States complain about the biased nature of working of this office 

8. Under Article 312, RS can authorise the Parliament to create 1 or more All India Services, AIS officers are apppointed by Center but they come under overall 
disciplinary control of Center, though they largely function in the senior positions under the State Govt. and by controlling AIS, center can influence the States

9. Under Article 256/257, Center can issue administrative directions to the States including the directions indicating the manner in which Railway properties and
other means of communication shall be maintained, these directions are binding on the States and if not followed then Center can dismiss the State govts. under
Article 365

10. Unequal representation given to States in RS depending upon the population of the States besides 12 nominees of the President in RS i.e. Council of States
is a clear violation of federal principle, for ex- the American federation gives equal representation to all the States in the Senate

Conclusion - On the account of all the above points we can conclude that Indian Federal Structure has a strong unitary bias and thus Indian Federation 
is sometimes referred as Federation Suigeneris. Dr BR Ambedkar said that rigidity and legalism are 2 serious weaknesses of a federal system thus rather than 
declaring India Federation of States, India was declared as Union of States

Fundamental Duties : Part IV A of the IC
-part IV A of the IC made part of IC through 42nd amendment act 1976 inspired by Const. of USSR and based on the recommendation of Sardar Swarn Singh committee, 1976 
-Article 51A mentions 11 fundamental duties of every Indian Citizen
-51A(a): to abide by Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, National flag and Anthem 
-51A(b): to cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired the Indian struggle for freedom
-51A(c): to uphold and protect the sovereignity, unity and integrity of India
-51A(d): to defend the country and render National service when called upon to do so 
-51A(e): to promote harmony and spirit of common brotherhood among all the people of India and renounce the practices derrogatory against to the dignity of women
-51A(f): to value and preseve the rich heritage of our composite culture 
-51A(g): to protect and improve natural environment and have compassion for living creatures 
-51A(h): to develop scientific temper, humanism and spirit of inquiry and reform
-51A(i): to safeguard public property and give up violence 
-51A(j): try to excel in all the spheres of individual and collective activities so that Nation constantly rises 
-51A(k): introduced through 86th amendment act 2002 under which it is a duty of every parent or guardian to provide opportunity for education to his child/ward(6-14y)

-IC does not carry the provision for direct enforcement of these duties i.e. there is no sanction/punishment to prevent their violation, however Parliament can 
enforce them by making a suitable legislation, Fundamental Duties are also referred to understand the limits on Fundamental Rights
-SC clarified that FD apply on States also because State is a reflection of citizen only 
-FD simply added in the IC may not achieve their real goal of making the people responsible rather people should be made aware about these duties proactively
along with changing the value system in the society in which we put the Nation first and not the familiy or the individual first

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fundamental Rights - Part III

-US was the first country to give a Constitutional status to a set of Rights called Fundamental Rights
-FR in the IC are largely inspired by the Bill of Rights in the American Constitution
-the rights given in part III of the IC are called Fundamental not only because they are provided by the fundamental law of the land i.e. Constitution but also
because these rights prevent the State from becoming arbitrary or authoritarian and thus they are fundamental for the creation of a civilised society 
-FRs are also fundamental because they are the most important assets with an individual to achieve his fullest physical, intellectual and spiritual potential/growth
-these rights are also quite fundamental for the healthy functioning of Democracy and thus FRs are referred as corner stone(identification) of Indian Democracy
-Part III and Part IV of the IC together constitute the conscience of the Constitution or the intellectual component of the Constitution

Difference btw Fundamental Rights and Ordinary Legal Rights 
-while OLR are enforced and protected by Ordinary Law of the land, FR are protected and guaranteed by the Constitution of the country itself
-in case of violation of FRs, the agrieved can approach the SC directly whereas if an OLR is violated then the agrieved gets the relief by approaching 
the sub-ordinate courts or by High Court but he cannot directly approach SC
-OLR can be changed by legislature through an ordinary process of law making however FRs can be changed only by amending the Constitution under Article 368

Nature of Fundamental Rights
-FRs are not absolute in nature since they are subject to reasonable restrictions and responsibilies attached to them 
-FRs provide protection to an individual primarily against State's action however few FRs are available against the State as well as against private individuals
for ex- Right against untouchability, Right to life, Right against exploitation

Doctrine of Eclipse
-under Article 13(1), all the laws enforced in India before the commencement of the Constitution shall be unconstitutional and void, if they violate 1 or more
than 1 provisions of part 3 of the Constitution i.e. Fundamental Rights, to the extent of such violation 
-in Bhikaji Narayan vs State of M.P. case 1955, SC applied the principle of Eclipse and said that such a pre-constitutional law if important enough can be given
protection under Doctrine of Eclipse i.e. the law can be put in the shadow of FRs rather than being declared unconstitutional because of which the law will 
remain inactive i.e. dormant and in the future if any amendment is able to end the clash btw the law and the FR then this law can be revived again
and made enforceable and till the time the law can be applied on the people whose FRs are not being violated by this law
-in Deepchand vs State of U.P. case 1959, SC held that Doctrine of Eclipse can be applied only to a pre-constitutional law and not to a post-constitutional law
as the post-constitutional law which violates the FR is invalid Ab initio, thus a post-constitutional law deserves no protection under Doctrine of Eclipse
-in Ambika Mills vs State of Gujrat case 1974, SC held by overuling its earlier judgement in Deepchand case that Doctrine of Eclipse can be applied to protect 
not only a pre-constitutional law but also a post-constitutional law

Amendability of Fundamental Rights
-Article 13(2) says that State shall not make any 'LAW' that takes away or abridges/reducing importance 1 or more FRs and if such a law is passed, if such a law is 
passed, then the law shall be unconstitutional and void to the extent of the inconsistency
-However seemingly against the provisions of Article 13(2), 
--the first amendment act 1951 introduced Article 15(4) which was apparently against the spirit of Article 15. 
--the first amendment act also amended Article 19(6) through which reasonal restrictions were put on Right to Vocation. 
--the first amendment act also introduced the 9th Schedule to the Constitution which took away the powers of Judicial review of the courts 
i.e. the laws added in the 9th Schedule were supposed not to be questioned in the court on the ground that the law was violative of FRs
-now the first amendment act was challenged before SC in Shankari Prasad vs Union of India case 1951, but the ruling came in the favour of Parliament 
-SC declared in the case that Parliament enjoys 2 types of legislative powers, first Ordinary legislative powers, and second Constitutional legislative powers
under Article 368. If Parliament makes use of Constitutional powers under Article 368 then the outcome is Constitutional Amendment which is not covered in the
ambit of 'LAW' as defined under Article 13(3) and thus will not be a violation of Article 13(2), however if Parliament excercises Ordinary legislative powers
then the result is 'LAW' as defined under Article 13(3) which comes under the scope Article 13(2) and would be void if it goes against 1 or more FRs
thus in Shankari Prasad Case, SC held that Parliament under Article 368 can amend any part of the IC including FRs
-in Golakhnath vs State of Punjab Case 1967, SC overuled its earlier decision and held that Article 368 contains only the procedure to amend the Constitution but
it does not confer the power upon the Parliament to amend the Constitution and thus Parliament cannot amend any part of the Constitution including FRs
-however Parliament responded by passing 24th amendment act 1971 which amended the title of Article 368 which now reads 'The Procedure to amend the Constitution
and the Power to amend the Constitution'
-in Keshavanand Bharati vs State of Kerala Case 1973, the 24th amendment act which amended the title of Article 368 was challenged among other things but the SC
upheld the Constitutional validity of 24th amendment act and declared that Parliament by the virtue of its powers under Article 368 can amend any part of the IC
under Article 368 including the amendments in FRs, however no amendment should disturb the basic structure of the IC
-however SC didn't define what the Basic Structure(BS) of the IC was, however in number of cases the Judiciary has been indicating those parts of the Constitution
which form the BS of the IC
-BS includes those provisions of the IC without which the IC may loose its basic character/nature, for ex- it includes 
--Supremacy of Constitution
--Rule of law
--SOP
--Checks & Balances 
--federalism 
--Judicial Review
--Independence of Judiciary 
--Socialism 
--Soveriegnity of India 
--Access to Justice 
--Unity & Integrity of India 
--Mandate/Purpose/Agenda to build a Welfare State etc.

-Clubbed all the FRs together depending upon their similar nature in 6 broad categories
1. FRs related to Equality - Article 14 to Article 18
2. FRs related to Freedom  - Article 19 to Article 22
3. FRs against Exploitation - Article 23 and Article 24
4. FRs related to Religion - Article 25 to Article 28
5. FRs related to Cultural & Educational Rights - Article 29 and Article 30
6. FRs related to Constitutional Remedies - Article 32
--[trick : 5 4 2 4 2 1]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 14 : Right to Equality
-it states that State shall not deny to any person 
a. Equality before law
-Equality before law is a concept which originated in England
-it is a negatively worded idea because 'Absense of privileges enjoyed by an individual in the eyes of law i.e. all persons irrespective of their rank or position
are equal before law and they shall be treated equally'
-this means that all persons are subject to the ordinary jurisdiction of court i.e. all can sue or can get sued before the ordinary court
-so Article 14 guarantees only jurisdictory(legal) equality and not complete equality
-however there are few exceptions to the concept of Equality before law
--the President or the Governor of the State is not answerable to the Court of law for discharging his official functions
--no criminal case can be started or continued against the President/Governor
--no civil case where relief is demanded can be started against the President or Governor without giving them a prior notice of 2 months 
--privileges given to legislators or protection given to diplomats are also exceptions to Equality before law

-Rule of Law
-the concept originated in England and is an integral part of the idea called Equality before Law i.e. EBL gives rise to ROL
-ROL means that law is Supreme i.e. Lex Supremus and there is absolute supremacy of regular law of the country as opposed to the influence of any arbitrary power
-with the adoption of ROL, the concept of administration has changed from Rex Lex(King is Law) to Lex Rex(Law is King)
-this is very essential to maintain order and stability in the society
-SC declared that ROL is so essential for healthy functioning of a civilised society that it is a component of basic structure of the IC
-ROL has 3 principles
1. no man can be punished or made to suffer except for violation of law and such a violation shall also be established/proven in the ordinary court of land
2. all persons are subject to the ordinary law of land without distinction
3. the 3rd principle of ROL as applicable in India is a modification of the 3rd principle of ROL of England which says in India, Constitution is the Supreme
Law of land and all the laws passed by the legislature must be consistent with the provisions of the IC

b. Equal protection of law
-the concept originated in USA, it is a positive concept which means Equality of treatment in Equal circumstances i.e. like should be treated alike 
-Equality does not mean uniform application of law under all circumstances but it means before applying the law situational variation must be taken into account
thus Article 14 guarantees Equality but only among Equals, thus Equal Protection of Law allows for what is called as Positive Discrimination/Protective Discrimation
under which even the Reservation Policy is valid

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 15 : Right against Discrimination
Aritcle 15(1) 
-State shall not discriminate against citizen only on the ground of Religion, Race, Caste, Sex, Place of Birth or any of them i.e.
-these conditions alone are not sufficient grounds to have discrimination done under Equal Protection of Law but these conditions must be accompanied with 
some other factors or circumstances to bring Positive Discrimination, for ex - when a caste is given Reservation then it is not because of the caste per say
rather it is because of the Backwardness attached with the caste

Article 15(2)
-prohobits State and Individual both from discriminating against citizens only on the ground of Religion, Race, Caste, Sex, Place of Birth or any of them in having
access to Public Places such as parks, hotels, hospitals, or wells, tanks, ghats, road maintained out of State's fund
-the right under Article 15(2) is fighting various social evils like Untouchability, Communalism, Racial Bias, Gender Discrimination, Regionalism etc.

Article 15(3)
-State is allowed to make special provisions for Women and Children

Article 15(4)
-introduced through 1st Amendment Act 1951
-State can make special provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or SCs and STs

Article 15(5)
-introduced through 93rd Amendment Act 2005, which empowers the State to make special provisions for the admission of backward classes of citizens in 
educational institutions whether public or private aided or unaided except minorities educational institutions

Article 15(6)
-introduced through 103rd Amendment Act 2019
-provides for Reservation upto 10% for economically weaker section in educational institutions whether public or private, aided or unaided except 
minority educational institutions

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 16(1)
-Provides for equality of opportunity to all the sections of citizens in public employment

Article 16(2)
-Prohibits State from discrimination against citizens only on the ground of Religion, Race, Caste, Sex, Place of Birth, Residence, Descent or any of them in gaining
public employment

Article 16(3)
-Parliament is empowered to provide by law , Residence as a ground or qualification to gain certain categories of public employment

Article 16(4)
-empowers the State to make special provisions in the favour of backward classes of citizens in reserving the posts of the nature of public employment 
if the backward class is not adequately represented in the services under the State and the said class of citizens is also socially and educationally backward
-SC in Indira Sawhney vs Union of India Case 1992, held that 
a. 27% reservation for OBCs in public jobs was constitutionally valid, however SC directed the State to identify the creamy layer among the OBCs and remove
them from the benefit of reservation
b. Court held that ordinarily reservation in the favour of backward classes shall not exceed 50% of the total seats 
c. SC also held that reservation should be a one-time benefit which can be availed at entry level only so SC declared the reservation given to SC/ST in promotion
to be unconstitutional and void 
d. to this, Parliament reacted by introducing Article 16(4A) through 77th Amendment Act 1995 which provided for Reservation in Promotion to SC/ST
e. As per the recent judgement of SC in State of Punjab vs Davinder Singh Case 2020, respective State legislatures can create sub-quota within the reserved quota
for SC/ST

Article 16(5) 
-it empowers the State to prescribe religion as a ground or qualification for the recruitment of candidates in certain categories of public employment

Article 16(6)
-introduced through 103rd Amendment Act 2019
-empowers the State to reserve upto 10% of seats for Economically Weaker Sections in public employment 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 17
-it provides a Fundamental Right against Untouchability in absolute terms without limitation or exception 
-neither Constitution  or Parliamentary laws defines untouchability but Judiciary has defined it as a social practice where a person only on the basis of his birth
in a particular caste is looked down upon and discriminated wrongly
-SC expanded the definition by declaring that any practice in which an individual or a group is considered polluted or impure and discriminated will also amount 
to practice of untouchability
-Untouchability Offenses Act 1955 which prescribed for the punishment for practicing untouchability has been renamed and strenghthened as Civil Rights (Proctection)
Act 1976

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article18(1)
-Prohibits the State from conferring any title except for Military or Academic distinction
-National awards also called as Padma Awards, started in 1954 are regarded as decorations or awards and not titles and therefore the awardee is not suppose to use
them as a prefix or suffix with their name
-SC held that National Awards are not violative of Principle of Equality because Right to Equality does not mandate that merit should not be recognised
