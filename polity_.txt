Union
-Parliament is the law making body of the Union
-it is bicameral, has two houses Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
-ideally, tenure of LS is 5 years, tenure of RS is infinite as it is a permanent body
-ideally, tenure of LS MPs is 5 years, tenure of RS MPs is 6 years
-in every 5 years, fresh elections are called to fill the LS
-in every 2 years, 1/3rd of the RS MPs retire, and new MPs are brought in
-at any point of time, atleast 2/3rd of the RS is always filled
-party that proves majority in LS forms the govt. their leader is made the P.M.
-the P.M. chosen has to be the member of the Parliament, if he is not so, he has to become a member within 6 months
-P.M. picks his council of ministers from LS/RS, collectively they are called Executives, or Govt. in layman's term
-Executives are those who implement laws made by the Legislative
-P.M. along with his council of ministers and a chain of officers (Bureaucracy) forms the Executives
-P.M. along with his council of minsiters are Political Executives, while chain of officers are Permanent Excecutives
-ministers chosen has to be a member of the Parliament, if not they have to be one withing next 6 months
-not every MP is a minister, but every minister is an MP
-P.M. can be from any of the house LS/RS, Manmohan Singh was from RS, Modi is from LK
-LK only containes elected members, RS has both elected, nominated members
-President nominates 12 members in the RS, who has exceptional knowledge in the field of Art/Literature/Science/Social Services
-Sachin Tendulkar, Mary Kom were exceptions that were nominated in RS from the field of Sports by the Supreme Court
-Constitutionally, Sports is not mentioned as the field to nominate someone
-The amendment act of 104 removed the 2 seats of Anglo-Indians that were nominated in the LS

State
-Similar to Parliament, we have State Legislative Assembly in the states
-6 states: UP, Bihar, Maharashtra, Karnataka, A.P., Telangana have 2 houses in the law making
-rest all states only have 1 house of law making
-the State Legislative Assembly and the State Legislative Council
-the members of the SLA are only elected just like LS, called MLA
-the members of the SLC are elected, nominated just like RS, called MLC
-Governor nominates some MLCs from the field of Art/Literature/Science/Social Science/Co-operative movements
-party that proves majority in the SLA forms the govt. 
-C.M. choses his council of minister in a similar way

Constitution
-many countries have written constitution, while many have unwritten constitution
-India, Srilanka, U.S. have written one, while U.K. NZ, etc have unwritten one 
-this implies that countries like ours have laws written/codified in a book which we can call constitution
-while other countries doesn't have such a book
-they have various laws but not a single book called Constitution
-Written Constitution is one whose articles and provisions are written/codified into a single legal document/book
-in WC, distinct is made btw the provisions of Constitution and other laws
-in WC, it is the Constitution which is supreme and all other organs(Parliament, Executive, Judiciary) of the state are suppose to follow it
-in WC, Judiciary generally enjoys wider powers where it can declare an enactment/law of Parliament or action of Executive to be unconstitutional and thus nullified

-WC is an enacted Constitution i.e. it was made by a special body at a specific point of time
-WC may be rigid/flexible or a combination of both, in India, some parts can be changed easily, some with difficulty
-countris with WC may be federal/unitary
-Unwritten Constitution is one whose provisions are not codified/compiled into a single legal document/book
-in UC, each and every enactment of the Parliament becomes part of their Constitution
-i.e. there is no distinction btw Constitutional and other laws
-in UC, Parliament is supreme because every enactment/law of the Parliament becomes their Constitution
-in UC, Judiciary cannot declare an enactment of Parliament as unconstitutional
-UC gives rise to unitary setup only
-UC is always flexible because all it takes to change the Constitution is to bring a new law by Parliament
-UC is an evolved one as it is an outcoming/efforts of many bodies over a period of time
-before the Constitution was written, it was decided primarily what should be the theme/objective/purpose of our IC
-Ojective Resolution was the document written by J.L. Nehru that served that basis
-it was moved before the Constituent Assembly where it was voted and accepted upon
-this document serverd as the basis on which the IC was written
-Preamble is the document that forms the summary of the IC
-Chronologically, the order was: Objective Resolution -> IC -> Preamble
-In India, laws that are written in the IC are called Constitutinal laws such as fundamental duties etc
-while laws not a part of the IC called Ordinary laws are inferior to these Constitutional laws, these are MNREGA, CAA etc
-it implies that these laws support the Constitutional ones
-CL are superior to OL because changing them is difficult and they act as a reference
-in U.K., as there's no constitution, every law is equal and holds equal value

Constitutionalism
-Constitutionalism means as system with a limited govt. i.e. a governance setup whose powers are not arbitrary or unrestricted i.e. 
it is a system having limited govt. 
-example of max. absence of Constitutionalism are: Hitler from Germany, Saddam Hussain from Iraq, Kim Jong-un from N. Korea, Gaddafi from Libya
-Hitler executed Jews whenever he wanted, Kim executes anybody he feels so
-Unlimited govt. is one which concentrates maximum power of administration in few hands which leads to corruption, violation of human rights
and encroachment/violation on the liberty of common man
-the provisions which ensure Constitutionalism are
-a democratically formed Constitution
-separation of powers(SOP)
-checks and balances
-independent Judiciary
-power of Judicial review
-rule of law, fundamental rights and various tools of transparency like RTI, e-governace etc
-Constitutionalism not only places limits on the powers of administration but it also requires that
people of the society also fulfil their duties and they do not become disrespectful to the laws in the country
-In India, political culture needs to improve with time so that the members of the govt. maintains self discipline and try not to break the law
-even civil society in India is divided on the grounds of religion, race, caste, language etc
-thus they do not put effective check on the govt. which weakens the idea of Constitutionalism

Parliamentry v/s Presidential system of govt.
--Parliamentary
-executive is a part of legislature
-here ministers are from Parliament only, or if not, they must become MP within a fixed time which in case of India is 6 months
-the council of ministers is represented by PM and this body the true executive making all the most important decisions of administration
-the President is the head of the state not having much real executive powers (decision making powers) and he is a nominal (name sake) head of the state 
-the COM is responsible to the LS in case of India
-it puts greater stress on the idea of responsible executive even if it is less stable 
--Presidential
-executive and legislature are two clearly 2 separate bodies
-here ministers are not part of legislature and the President choses his team of ministers from amongst the citizens at large
-President is the real head executive of the state who is also the head of the govt. having a ministerial cell (COM) to assist/guide him
-President and his ministerial cell is not much responsible to the legislature
-it puts greater stress on the idea of a stable executive even if it is less accountable to the legislature

Separation of Power
-the French philosopher Montesquieu gave the idea of SOP in which 3 organs of the state i.e. legislature, executive and judiciary
shall be separated into water type compartments with an objective of preventing the state from becoming totalitarian (absolutely powerful)
-thus individual liberty can be safeguarded 
-USA was the first nation to implement this idea
-India accepted the idea of SOP in a modified form called the principle of 'Checks and Balances'
where all the 3 organs of the state i.e. legislature, executive and judiciary exercise some form of control over each other
and thus all the three organs maintain a balance among each other and impose responsibility on each other
-India follows Parliamentary system of govt. where executive is a part of legislature and thus pure SOP is not possible
-SC in 1996 declared that the theory of SOP and the basic structure of the Constitution is an integral part of IC
and thus both of them form the elements of basic structure of the IC

Preamble
-Preamble is regarded as the introduction or prelude (beginning) to the Constitution
-it carries the essence/summary of the whole Constitution
-it also contains the basic values which are found in the Constitution
-according to D.D.Basu, it contains the philosophy or the theme of the Constitution
-it contains the key to unravel the minds of Constitution makers and it tells us the intentions 
they had in the mind regarding various provisions of the Constitution
-it is in the form of a declaration but it does not confer any substantive powers on the organs of the govt.
or citizens nor it limits those powers
-it cannot overwrite specific provisions of the Constitution i.e. Preamble is subordinate to Constitution 
if there's a clash btw an article of the Constitution and the Preamble then former shall prevail over the Preamble
-as per SC if there is an ambiguity surrounding an article of the Constitution then that interpretation of the article
may be used by the courts which tallies/matches with the Preamble
-Preamble has an enacting clause where it declares that the Constitution of India was enacted and adopted on 26 Nov. 1949
-Preamble of IC declares that the source of all the powers of the Constitution is the people of India themselves 
i.e. Constitution arises from people only which means that Preamble indicates that people of India are the ultimate
sovereign, however in Keher Singh vs Union of India case 1989, the statement was challenged that Constitution derives 
its powers from people directly, but the court said that this statement that Constitution derives its powers from people 
directly is a legal fiction but it is a conclusive assumption which cannot be tested or challenged in any 
court of law and should be accepted as such 
-Preamble contains the ideals and the aspirations of people of India
-Ideals are the means to achieve the aspirations
-5 ideals mentioned are Sovereignity, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic
-4 aspirations are Liberty, Justice, Equality and Fraternity
-Preamble may help the judiciary in giving the legal interpretation of the Constitutional provisions
Is Preamble part of the Constitution
-the traditional view was that Preamble was not a part of the Constitution because even it is removed from the Constitution, 
the Constitution would continue to function further unlike the Constitution, Preamble does not confer or limit the powers of the organs of the state
and thus Preamble has a very limited role to play in the Constitution. SC in Berubari case 1960 held that Preamble was not a part of the Constitution
but the modern view is that Preamble is considered to be part of the Constitution because only if Preamble is a part of Constitution 
then only it can be amended under Article 368 to maintain a pace with the modern day Constitution and Parliamentary Philosophy, 
therefore SC over wrote its earlier decision in Kesavananda Bharati vs State of Kerala case 1973 that Preamble is a part of Constitution

Sovereignity
-Sovereignity means that the country's govt is totally independent and it does not acknowledge any arbitrary power as supreme with 
regard to the governance of the country either within its boundary or internationally
-in the era of Liberalisation, Privatisation, Globalisation (LPG) when every country is a part of number of International Agreements, treaties
and agencies it is said that countries have lost their freedom to take independent decisions which is a question mark on their soverignity
and India is not an exception, however this argument may not be completely true particularly for India since even in the globalised world
India is taking decisions keeping in mind the highest interest of people of India and its constitutional values and India does not agree to
-India does not give in to any kind of arbitrary pressure, moreover in the National Interest if India has to put its foot down India does so 
whether it was Dokhlam stand off or resisting the American pressure with regard to S400 missiles so largely the global factors have not 
eroded the Sovereinity of India

Secularism
-Secularism means that the state does not acknowledge its closeness with any particular religion i.e. state shall not recognise any particular
religion as the official religion of the country.
-in Indian context, it means state is neither religious nor irreligious/anti-religious rather India is non-religious in character
-in India, all the religion that have made India their home have the right to co-exist in the soil of India
-most of the western countries like France or Germany also maintain a secular orientation since these countries also do not show 
affiliation to any specific religion however unlike India where state promotes all the religions. In the west, state maintains a distance 
from church/religion which means every religion for example- in west, if govt. takes decision, the decisions are taken for their objective
value, however when in India, decisions are taken, the decisions do not ignore the religious sentiments or religious understanding of any religion
-India actively promotes all the religion, whereas in west, state does not invest to promote in religion which includes all the religion
if analysed deeply then the approach of secularism taken up by India is better than the secular approach of the west as it brings more security
and consolation among the people of all the religions as they feel that state is there to protect their religious practices and religious sentiments

Socialism
-Socialism in general means that benefit of the societal resources should reach every member of the society 
and nobody should be left out from enjoying the benefits of the resources. 
-Also concentration of wealth in few hands should be prevented unlike USSR which tried to achieve socialistic goals 
through the model called Marxist Socialism involving complete Nationalisation
-in India we took up the model of Democratic Socialism or Fabian Socialism in which socialistic goals are to be achieved but through Democratic means 
-in which private ownership and private businesses are also allowed besides govt. ownership and govt. enterprises (PSU) 
-it is a case of mixed economy supported by policies like Progressive Taxation, Land Ceiling Act, and govt. run welfare schemes etc

Democracy
-Democracy is a system where people decide regarding the decisions of the govt.
-in this context every member of the society should be allowed to express and be heard while making decisions of governance
so in a way it is governance by the people
-Democracy can be direct where people directly tell about their views regarding particular questions of governance however its not quiet practical 
to implement direct democracy in India because of huge population and a big size of the population being illiterate so we follow indirect democracy 
or representative democracy where people choose their representatives and these representatives take the decisions of governance on the behalf of people
thus incorporating the views and the aspirations of every member of society in the decision making process though indirectly
-Democracy is very crutial for the overall development of the country however certain threats or weaknesses particularly in Indian Democracy
-for example, people choosing wrong representatives to become their voice in the governance system is a big threat however this often happen
-this happens because criminal elements or non serious candidates becoming the voice of people which happens because many of them buy votes
and some are brought to power by the misuse of muscle power
-people voting for parochial factors like religion, race, caste, language, region can also bring wrong representatives to power which can 
weaken democracy
-people not excercising right to vote also weakens democracy
-representatives not communicating with the group they represent also weakens democracy
-however this vacuum can be filled through unbiased media
-however considered the 4th pillar of democracy if becomes biased and corrupt then this can destabilize democracy and encourage people
to take wrong decisions in future also 
-misuse of various laws to suppress political dessent is also a threat to democracy
-political defections for personal benefit will also weaken democracy 
-illiteracy and poverty are also two weaknesses or threat to democracy
--however the ray of hope lies in 
-electoral reforms particularly to fight criminalisation of politics
-making the anti-defection law effective
-fighting fake news
-independent and strong judiciary is a must for democracy
-people voting more in number and voting responsibly will strengthen democracy
-tools of accoutability like RTI and e-governance will also strengthen democracy

Republic
-Republic is a system where people are supreme and even the head of the state is elected by people and there is no hereditary ruler in the country

Aspirations of Preamble
--Justice
-Preamble talks about comprehensive justice i.e. Political, Social and Economic Justice achieved through various provisions of the Constitution like
-Political Justice achieved through right to vote and right to contest in the election under Article 326
-Social Justice achieved through fundamentals rights under Article 14, 15, 17, 18 etc
-Economic Justice achieved through various fundamental rights like right to vocation or various directive principles
--Liberty
-Liberty is the absence of arbitrary powers exercised by an individual or an institution against other individuals or group thereby allowing
the individual or the group an opportunity to grow or achieve their full potential  
--Equality
-Preamble talks about equality of opportunity and equality of status
--Fraternity
-Fraternity is a sense of brotherhood that prevails among all the people of India which is very essential to promote the unity and integrity of India
and save the dignity of individual

Part 2
Citizenship
-A Citizen is an individual who enjoys the full membership of the country and he enjoys all the rights available in the country
-there are some rights in India which are reseverd for Indian citizens only for example- the right under Article 15, 16, 19, 29, 30, 326 etc
-the IC does not lay down permanent or detailed provisions regarding the citizenship in India 
-Part 2 of the IC simply describes the classes of persons who would deamed to be the citizen of India at the commencement of the Constitution
and has the detailing of the laws regarding citizenship onto Parliament
-Article 11 of the IC confers the powers onto the Parliament to make laws on Citizenship and using this power Parliament enacted Indian Citizenship Act 1955
which provides for the acquisition and termination of Indian Citizenship
-the IC provides only for single citizenship and prohibits dual 
-Indian Citizenship Act 1955 is based on 2 legal principles
--1st is Jus Soli i.e. law of soil 
--2nd is Jus Sanguine i.e. law of blood

Indian Citizenship Act 1955 as amended from time to time provides for 5 ways through which 1 can acquire the Indian Citizenship

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Federal vs Unitary
-In a federal system, 2 forms of govt. co-exist and none is inferior to other as both derive their powers from Constitution itself
-in a federal system, Constitution has to be written and it should divide the powers between Center and States and this division of powers 
btw Center and States is binding upon both the Center as well as the States i.e. Constitution is supreme, also Federal Constitution are difficult
to amend i.e. they are rigid by nature, this way the division of power btw Center and the States can be protected from any undue/unrequired change
either by Center alone or by State alone rather if Constitution needs to be amended it must be amended with the mutual concent of both Center and States
-in federal system to maintain the division of power btw Center and State and resolve the disputes over the division power btw them there must be an 
independent arbitrator who must also have the power to interpret the Constitution, for ex - in India, Supreme Court is one such power
-US, Australia, Canada

-In Unitary system, there exists 1 supreme govt. i.e. at Center though State governments are there but they are only the administrative arms of Center
working as per directions of Center
-in Unitary system, Constitution may be written or unwritten
-Unitarty system will have a flexible Constitution which can be changed by Parliament alone 
-in Unitary system, Judiciary may not be that powerful, particularly with respect to its jurisdiction on the areas related to distribution of powers
btw Center and States
-France, Britain

Nature of Indian Federal Constitution
-experts believe that IC is federal, though some believe it is not truly federal rather it is quasi-federal or a federation with bias towards Unitarism
-howerver SC said that whatever is the degree of federalism in IC, federalism is the part of basic structure of the IC
-due to the following features, we can conclude that IC is a federal Constitution or atleast near to it
